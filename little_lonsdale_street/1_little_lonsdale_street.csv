Have you ever noticed that people who are successful look like,

never think of failure. Apart from the usual ""hard work” which Is a necessary
part of success, this mental outlook has a definite bearing In en abling those
who are often erroneously termed “lucky” to achieve their ambi tions. Compare
those who are failures and who are shrouded in a dismal at mosphere of non-

Most likely you are ""out of sorts,” ""In poor health,” “not feeling too good”
or you “have a liver,” Many serious disorders can be traced di rectly to the
liver or the kidneys. Indi gestion, dyspepsia, flatulence and con stipation
are the beginnings of that “run down” feeling and lead to more serious
ailments unless the kidneys and liver are restored to health and activity. The
blood should normally be transformed, cleansed and filtered by these organs,
otherwise urinary (kid ney) and biliary (liver) poisons con taminate the
blood, which, in its turn, cannot absorb the liquified nutriment of digested
food so essential to our well-being. Warner’s Safe Cure permanently re lieves
indigestion and dyspepsia by restoring the kidneys and liver to health and

nourishing the digestive or gans. An illustrated booklet dealing with kidney

After more than a fortnight's searching for the whereabouts of Amelia
Bunnctte, an old-aged pen sioner, who was keeping house for Mr. Thomae Bullen,
wlio resides at No. 1 Little Lonsdale street. South

Gcelong, the mystery surrounding her sudden disappearance has been solved. The
body o£ tho missing woman was discovered floating in the Barwon River
yesterday. About 31 o'clock yesterday morning Mr. David Bone, of Barrabool
road. Belmont, was in the locality of Prince's Bridge, when he saw tho dead
body of some person floating in the Barwon River, about 200 yards from the
bridge, and close to the south bank. He immediately communica ted with
Constable \V. C. Rapkins, of Belmont, and together tlioy recovered the body
from the river, when it was discovered as being that of a woman Subsequently
the body was identified as being that of the missing woman Tho deceased was
fully dressed, and the body was conveyed to the City Morgue. The constable
reported the matter to tho Deputy Coroner, Mr. W. R. Anderson, J. P., who
intimated that he will give an order for burial, and hold an inquest 011
Monday morning at 30 o'clock. Deceased, who had been residing at Mr. Bullen's
house since girlhood, was 6S years of age. When Mr. Bullen ar rived home from
work on July 2S, the deceased was going about her duller as usual. As he was
not feeling too well Mr. Bullen retired to bed imme diately after tea, leaving
the woman to attend to domestic duties. When be awoke on tbe following morning
lie could not see the woman about. Accordingly he knocked at her bed room
door, but received no answer. Fearing perhaps that something un usual had
happened he opened the door and an inspection of her room revealed the fact
that her bed appa rently had not been occupied over night. He immediately
reported the matter to the police, and inquiries were made for the missing
woman. As previously reported. Mr. Bullen, who was anxious to solve the
mystery, learned from his neighbors. Mr. and Mrs. Mclaren, thai foutstcps were
heard 011 the verandah «»n the previous night at about 11 o'clock. Mr. Mc
Laren asked if anything Avas the mat ter, but a woman replied that she wanted
to sec Mrs. McLaren. The latter then asked the woman what she wanted, but tho
only reply was that she was all right, and the woman left the house. Nothing
further was heard about the missim? woman until yes terday. when the body was
found floating in the river. Foul play is no1 suspected.
