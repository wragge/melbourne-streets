The western continent has been especially",,"A BEMARKABLE EECORD.

The origin, growth, and final success of any enter prise are causes for the
greatest public interest, whether relating to public institutions or private
ventures. The western continent has been especially marked by examples of this
nature, and we are glad to record one which is so prominent as to be of uni
versal interest. Several years since Mr. H. H. Warner, reading in Rochester,
M.Y., became aware that vhat he supposed was an iron constitution was becoming
rapidly undermined, and that something of a mys terious nature seemed to be
sapping his vitals. At first the indications were slight, consisting prin
cipally of frequent headaches, dull pains in various parts of the body,
unaccountable lassitude, and occasions] naosea. He thought that perhaps these
symptoms were the result of a ooM^uad gave them but little attention, but they
Increased and finally became alarming. Consultation with two prominent
physicians revealed the fact that he was Buffering from aa acute attack of
kidney disease, and to say that he was alarmed would be only to partially
express his feelings. Under the most careful atten tion of the physicians,
however, he failed to improve, and. In (act, grew worse constantly. Bis
symptoms at this time were most serious. The alight troubles which he had
first observed increased, and finally became intense. What originally were
simple pains became the greatest agony. Occasional headaches \- and a lack of
energy eventually resulted in the pains

and honors which only such troubles can bring. It was at this critical time
that he heard of a tropical plant, which was reputed to be of great value in
similar troubles. Be had little faith in its power, but resolved to tnr it, as
nothing else seemed to in any wav relieve him. Be therefore ceased taking the
medicine of the doctors, began the use of the article referred to, and was
aware in a very short space of time that it was greatly ben eS tin* him. He
con tinned its use faith! ally, and as a result became perfectly

oured. has been one of the most active men in Amenoa ever sinoe, and is to-day
a picture of perfect

health.

Mr. Warner's experience caused him to thoroughly and most carefully
investigate, and as a result he dis covered that the majority of common
diseases could be traced in their origin to disorders of the kidneys or liver.
Ibis was a revelation so startling in its nature that, as a duty to humanity,
Mr. Warner felt impelled to make known to the world the great means by which
he had been saved. Up to that time kidney diseases had increased at the rate
of 26 per cent, each year for the past half soore of years, and were stiU
largely on the increase. With the end in ' view above described, however, Mr.
Warner began

preparing and selling the remedy referred to, sinoe i which time the demand
for it has been remarkable.

' In all the history of the world there is no instance on ' reoord where so
great a demand has been known ss . that existing for Warner's Safe Cure in the
United i States, England, and Canada, for all diseases of the

kidneys, liver, and urinary organs, and for sale by i every chemist in the
land. Were the call for this

remedy a fictitious one, mortality from kidney troubles would now be as great
AS ever, but statistics show that, for the past few years, there has been a
marked decrease of deaths from this class of diseases, > although the tendency
toward kidney troubles is as

great as ever. The theory, therefore, which Mr. Warner advanced has been
proven the correct one by reason of tho decrease of mortality shown by Govern
ment statistics.

Not long after presenting this medicine to the American publlo, Mr. Wamer
introduoed it into England. Kidney and liver difficulties are very

Srevalent over there, owing largely to the nature of

te climate and influence of the atmosphere. The

same results, however, which were noticeable In America were to be found in an
equal degree in Europe. The remedy conquered the disease.

Strange as it may seem, this great medicine, which has become so popular in
the United States, England, and Canada, has never been introduoed into
Australia, owing to the fact that the large amount of business coming from the
demand prevented an extension of the field, We learn,- however, that Messrs.
Warner ana Co. have reoently established an Australian house at 1(7 Little
Lonsdale-street, in this city, for the pur pose of supplying the demand which
has already sprang upland our friends arc to be oongratalated on this fact The
financial and social standing of Messrs. H. H. Warner and Co. in the United
States is second to that of no house in existence. The well-known public
spirit and liberality of Mr. Warner in con tributing to the wants of the South
during the yellow fever epidemic; endowing the celebrated Warner Astronomical
Observatory at Booh ester, N.Y., I at an expense of nearly £20,000, aud
encouraging toe I advancement of scienoe by the generous expediture 1 of money
in prises for oometary and meteoric dte

1 coveries, are .known to tt»e entire w<*M. and mark I aim as one of the
leading patrons ot.aeienoe of this

day. Success suub as has.been aautoved by this house, and of so high an order.
Is wholly meritorious sod deserved, and while it is phenomenal, it is none the
less of the greatest value to the entire wjesan continent.-{Ami

TO SAY • NO ' WHEN THERE 18 NO

JUSTIFICATION IS TO FiE A SHIRKER

SOME COMMON REASONS.

So far ilOO replies to tho persona 1 np^ peals tor enlistment havo reached
il.c' i-ity recruiting committee, and

recruiting sergeants, Sgt-.-Major Mi> lard and agt. Pratt, are tabulating the
answers. Many married men state that they are not- prepared to eulist tiii
the. single men do their duty. Others promise to enlist as soon as steps are
taken by the authorities to intern the Germans and Austrians, who, it is
complained, are allowed freedom of ac tion. One man, in answering ""So,"" said
he cook no interest in tlio Wfir. Another said, ""When nil the capital ists'
sons enlist I will b-e willing.'' it was .stated by another that ""Germs""
bosses are entering into daily hie in Australia, and that single ni«u i i r.-i
walking about, many being content to l,o kept by their mothers receiving
pensions.Some of the reasons sot fovt.i for not enlisting are us under -

Financially embarrassed. Defective sight.

Indifferent health.

Mother and sisters to keep.

Bad ann.

Ruptured muscles of tho knee.

Earnings as a soldier insufficient to keep family.

Delicate wife and children to suppjrt. Injured spine.

Impossible to get mother's eonson"".. ■

Cannot sacrifice business.

Aged person dependent on ;r.e lor

support.

Conscript single men.

The publication of the detail figures is being discontinued, in accordance

itli the wishes of the. State Recruiting Committer-, but. it is admitted that
the larger proportion of the replies is ""'Xo.

The married men appear to bo waiting nil the single men, an(i so many
re;:-.'ie-> contain the plea of indifferent health. or seme chronic disorder,
tlir.t the recnit mg sergeants have been forced to tho conclusion that Geelong
must be tho ''.time of physical derelicts. in a ceup'o of days nil tho Geelong
city replies will havo. been received, classified and .->!it on to tiie local
committee. who will •.ben be in u. position to instruct the iccruiting
sergeants to begin intcr vicwiiig the Xo-men.

To clear up any misnnderstandin,'': thii V.I).A. wishes it- to be understood

tor. Lawyers will assist soldiers in the preparation of their wills, arrr.lgo

The adjourned meeting of the Of the City Council was held on Thursday at three
p.m. At the previous meeting the principal business transected was the
adoption o f a motion affecting the suppression of

]>ubllc hoiircs, tnored by Councillor JL AJ. Smith; pm •be Becoptllllc. ,, of
lenders for the forming of street, nnd portions of Coliiog street and Victor!
i Parade, and metalling a road w..y thirty feet wide in tlic cenirr, nt an
expense Ot £7315; and also for_ laving the fligging in front of luc I’own
flail, Po'ico Office, and Post Office, ot an expense o f Bs. Bd. per yard, A
motion was also carried to the efteot dial her Maje ly should ben quested to
sit for her jortrait, to be hung in the To»u Hall. On Thursday, Councillor
Smith moved that Iho Guv«rmn<‘nf be r« quested to furnish informal o
respecting tho prov d.oi mu..e for the defence of the Colony agi.in-t
oggrersion, The motion was, how «ver, considered to be out of ord*-r. and the
proposals woie maoo sunjoots of comispoudence. Councillor J. M. Smith thou
proceeded with the of tho day, and moved, ao-mdoJ by Councillor Davis— That
that Public Works' Committee bo instructed to inquire and report— 1\. As to
tho necessity of having the lands situate in Melbourne, which are reserved for
tho use aud recreation of the citizens, enclosed. 2\. The most desirable
description of fence. 2.—The probable expense. .Carried unanimously.

It was next moved by Councillor J, M. Smith, and secontod by Councillor Davis—
'That the attention of the City Inspector and bis Assistants be called to the
wanton damage and dis gusting nuisances oommii ted on the Reserve, East
Melbourne, called FitzRoy Square, by removal of the surface soil and the
deposit of filth and dead animals.’ Carried. In reference to the foregoing
resolution, it was stated that the City Inspector and his Assistants (of whom
he had an extensive corps drawing salaries from the City) were amenable to
censure for the gross neglect of their duty, in not preventing or removing
these nuisances, and prosecuting the par ties guilty of them, according to Jaw
; but instead of attending to their proper duties, they were all employed as
clerks in the Police Office. It was pro posed that this should bo put a stop
to, and that these officers should either be dismissed or compelled to do
their duty. It was moved by Councillor Bell, nnd seconded by Councillor Grave—
* That the Public Works Committee bo instructed to have Gore street, between
Victoria parade and Webb street, formed on its permanent level, and a roadway,
30 feet wide, metalled in the centre.’ Carried. The following resolutions wore
moved by Aider man Clowes, seriatim, and being duly seconded, were severally
tarried : Thai the following tenders for public works bo accepted, vir.:— 1\.
—Bourke Street, between King nnd Spencer Streets, to bo formed on its

private lanes in block 18, under the provisions of the Private Streets and
Alleys Act. Messrs Hope and M’Kenzio, 104D. And recommending appropriations
for these works to the extent, of the contract prices. In reference to the
foregoing resolutions. Council lor Davis objected to the extensive and
independent powers of appropriating the city revenue, at prr sent exercised by
the Publlic Works Committee, without any direct reference to the Council for
the previous approval of thoir estimates aid cootruois. The Council had no
right to relieve itself of so important a responsibility, or entrust it
absolutely to any com 'niitteo, however honorably and efficiently composed.
Tbo committee should firs: report the nature, extent, ond estimated expense of
their proposed works to the Council, and get irs consent to the contracts they
enter into, and for the expenditure of tho moneys required for their
operations. Aldermen Clowes and Councillor J. M. Smith vindicated the Public
Works Committee, of which they were members, from any unauthorised usurpa tion
of power in the course of administration wl/lob they wore persuing. It was in
perfect accordance with the general authority vested in them by the Council,
which simply oroered certain work* to be done, and instructed the committee to
see them carried out to the best advantage with the means at their disposal.
If they wore unworthy of tho trust, or if it were deemed expedient to rrcv.li
it m l plaoo the fum-tions of the omnniiucc on a different foot ing, tbo
proper course wns to give due no; ice and pass a special resolution rescinding
the existing ;ir angement; and if that course was adopted, the members of that
committee would bo very glnd to get rid of the responsibility and care which
ut present devolved upon them. It was moved by Councillor Davis, and seconded
hi Councillor Walsh— That application be made to the Executive Govern raeut
for a grant of two acres of land ut tnc north west angle of the gaol reserve,
and of the triangular portion adjoining, bonndod on ho north-east by Victoria
Street, on the west by Swsnston S.reet, unu on the south by A’Beckett Street,
as a site for u general market, and wood ami hay market for North Melbourne.
Carried. Moved by Councillor Davis, and second and by Councillor Grave— That
the salary o; the keeper of the Flinders Street weighbridge be increased to
£2OO per annum. Carried. It was moved by Aldermin Clowes, and seconded by
Councillor Smith— That £lOOO be appropriated to defray the cost of diverting
the water channel in A’Beckct Street, and adopting measures for tho protection
of private proper ( y from carnage, from the rush of water in that vicinity,
af.cr heavy falls of ruin. Carried. It was in -.ved hy Councillor Davis, and
seconded by Councillor Walsh— That the issue by the Market Committee, of
Hackney Carriage Drivers' Licenses to John Mooney, Michael Donahoo, Henry Rae,
John Crawley, Thomas Kirkland, Henry Brock, William Manton, and William Clyde,
be confirmed. Carried. Moved by Councillor Powoll. and seconded by Councillor
Cboko — I That the Public Works Committee bo in, siructed, before calling for
tendeis Ur any

work, to have plans and specifications of the M»nao ready for inspection. 2\.
That the Acting Ouy Surveyor be instructed to prepare estimates of the
probable cost of any , work before the calling for any tender lor the same.
3\. That in all cases where only one tender has been reeeived for any work,
and such tender is greatly in excess of the Acting City Surveyor's estimate,
the Public Works Committee be in structed to reject tbo same and cull for
fresh tenders. Carried. It was moved by Councillor Davis, and seconded by
Councillor J. M. Smyth:— ‘That as the practice of Members of Gonncil pressing
their relatives into tho service of the Cor poration is obvionsly calculated
to engender favour itism, and extravagance in tho salaries, to lessen tho
independence of the Members, and must tend generally to the prejudice of the
Corporation service, the Legislative Committee be requested to prepare a Bill,
prohibiting Members of Council voting, for the election of their relatives,
and rendering void tho election to office, in fnture, of any relative of a
Member of Council. A rather warm bat irregular debate arose on this motion,
which it is impossible for us to report, or giveany correct idea of. Mr. Davis
supported his motion with considerable delicacy, but firmly; showing the
discredit which n system of nepotism was 'Calculated to bring upon tho
Corporation ; and that if such practices were uphold, instead of being
discarded, they would destroy the reputation of that Council, and deprive it
of public confidence. Councillor J. M. Smith followed tho same lino of
argument. Throwing delicacy aside, ho maintained that bo could not d'schnrgo
his duty by the exposure of these abuses without being personal, and giving
offence to certain parties. But ho was resolved to freely risk all that, and
do what he considered his duty to tho public, without fear or favor. He then
proceeded (amid constant intermptionn from Coun cillor Hayward) to specify in
detail a series of oases of palpable nepotism in the appointment of officers
and others in the employ of tho Corporation, tho majority of whom were either
brothers, brothers-in law, or near relatives of certain members of that
Council. Such a state of things was scamlnlona in tho eyes of the public, and
could not exist without detriment to tho public interest. It was necessary,
therefore, to take some decisive stops to put an end to it. Councillor Grave
vindicated himself from nny implication in the charge of undue influence or
interest in any election. Ho always voted inde pendently, and for what he
considered to be tho best man, without oaring whose brother or relative he
was. Councillor Day ward defended tho election of his brother ns a rate
collector,as being the most compe tent candidate. He did not think the Council
should tic up their hands by any such law as that proposed from electing a fit
and proper person for a civic office, merely because ho happened to bo related
to one of tho members of that Council. No such law had ever existed. It was
altogether a new principle sprung up, which had never been tried before. Ho
thought it was not competent for them to enter tain it. A motion for an
adjournment was then carried, and the Council rose at six o’clock.

The Bishop of MELANESIA'S appeal to bhe people of Victoria comes recom- mended
to us with all the force of a per- sonal character, rare among Christian
missionaries, The earnestness, intre- pidity, and devotion, which have earned
for Bishop PATTESOK SO h'gh a name amongst his fellow-labourers, are a
guarantee of the truthfulness of the claim which he puta forward on behalf of
the Melanesian missions upon the Victorian public. The results of missionary
teach- ing would bo open to fewer exceptions, were all missionaries such as
the Bishop of MELANESIA. The see, one of the latest creations in the Anglican
Church, is, perhaps, the most romantic in which a bishop ever had to labour.
There is something singularly remote from the conventional notions of an
episcopacy in the islands which form Dr. PATTESON'S diocese. It is the wildest
and most primitive region which a successor of the Apostles might tread. Here
Nature is absolutely free, and revels in entire undress, Here the "" noble
savage"" loams, in uncorrupted nobility. Here the very retreat that poets have
dreamt ,of, under

""Larger constellations burning, mellow

moons, and happy skies,""

is realized, where the Western Pacific has thrown up the bright coral world,
with its perpetual summer, its tangled greenery, its leaping cascades, and
wooded hills. Here, whero "" all but the "" spirit of man is divine,"" and where
nothing breaks the monotony of the cocoa-nut and the banana but the proud
trophies of the island warriors and the emblems of their industiy-the rows of
skulls and the baking-ovens.

A rarer field for missionary enterprise cannot be conceived than Melanesia.
The manners and customs of the na- tives are distinguished by a singular
breadth and simplicity. They are, in the first place, resolute lovers of their
kind, and perfect epicures in man. A bishop

on his visitation is liable to some severe

shocks, from the too profuse hospi- tality of his entertainers. Dr. PATTESON
once slept with a chief, the ridge-pole of whose tent was ornamented with
twenty seven human skulls; while an oven close by was strongly suggestive of
the use to which their proprietors had been put. The narrator might have
inten- sified our sympathy for himself, under these trying circumstances, by
remind- ing us of the fact that, in the New Hebrides, they once actually ate a
bishop, of the Roman Catholic persuasion. The very chief who entertained Dr.
PATTESON might have dined off baked bishop, and acquired a taste for episcopal
meat. Such are among the trials of missionary life in Melanesia !-The social
condition of the people ia depicted in the saddest colours. Sons bury their
parents alive ; and an intelligent boy has been known to strangle his mother
on his father's death. A girl will jump off a cliff to cure a heartache j
others, out of sheer vexation, will swim out to sea, and be eaten by shark3.
Wars are perpetual, and the climate is deadly. Under these circum- stances,
the missionary work has to be carried on at great risk, and by a slow and
painful process. The missionary has to commence proceedings by landing on the
beach, and establish- ing a confidence by the gift of fish- hooks. Six months
after, the fish- hooks having fructified, he would revisit tho island, learn a
few words of the language, and bring away a boy or two. A depot for the boys
is esta- blished in New Zealand, who are taught Christianity and. the useful
arts, and

then sent back to convert their

brethren. The duty of the bishop him- self appears to be to cruise among the
islands of his see in a schooner of ninety tons burden, to exert the influence
of his presence to put down, as far as possible, the horrors of savagery, to
bring away boys for the Melanesian College in New Zealand, and to confirm and
protect the native teachers who have returned thence, and are engaged in
spreading a kaow ledge of Christianity among their eountiymen.

It is impossible to speak anything but good of so pious and excellent an enter
prize, whatever misgivings we may have as to the working of foreign missions
in general. If there is any man calculated to succeed in changing the hearts
of the savage islanders of the Western Pacific, it is Bishop PATTESON. In one
thing especially he merits our commendation, in not exaggerating the value of
what has been already done for the conversion of Melanesia, nor in in- dulging
in too high expectations of what is to be done. The ten- dency of the
missionary mind is gene- rally grossly to over-estimate both the effect and
the worth of its teaching. Bishop PATTESOK is too sonsible a man not to
perceive that to mako Christians of the Melanesians will bo a slow and
laborious work. He is too brave a man

to bo deterred personally from the task because of its dangers and
difficulties. The duty from which even the bold spirit of LIVINGSTONE has
recently shrunk ap- palled is not one, in fact, which every ordinary agent of
the missionary socie- ties is competent to undertake, or even to comprehend.
It is a duty which, abovo all others, demands all the highest qualities of the
pure, good man, de- voting himself to one single end, in entire forgetfulue88
of self-the pro*

phct, truly BO called, who is inspired to speak and to teach, by some
influence deeper and higher than that of a mis- sionary society. Such
missionaries aro not ready made, at the service of the societies. The work is
one which belongs purely to the individual, and not to any collective body or
board. All that is great and lasting in it has been done by individual men,
out of the force of personal character, and not by boards or societies.
XAVIER, SCHWARTZ, and HENRY MASTYN, wero not mere agents of conversion. It is
on men like these, and not on the organized opera- tions of societies sitting
in London, that we have to rely for the success of Christian missions. The
vice of the so- cieties is, that they contribute too much to that spirit of
self-approbation which is so marked a characteristic of the Bri- tish
religious world. The subscriber to foreign missions is too often indulged in
the habit of giving, as though the gift itself was less on behalf of the
heathen than of himself-a fund, not so much for the conversion of the heathen,
as the propitiation of his own conscience. The believer's own piety receives
credit and refreshment by every pound which goes lo the Baiagonian or the
Feejeean ; and the missionary is

really but a hired substitute, in whose,, hiring every demand of religion is
be- lieved to be satisfied. It is not sur- prising that, under such a
dispensation, the amount of work done by the mis- sionaries, rather than its
quality, has come to be chiefly considered-that the missionary is tempted to
exaggerate the tale of his successes, just as an American general falsifies
his Jlst of prisoners and cannons captured-that the work itself is done
superficially, perfunctorily, and as rather a human piece of labour than

a Divine commission.

What moral results the Keporfc of the Commissioners of Savings Banks may
exactly represent is beyond the reach of official arithmetic to calculate, but
there is a satisfaction in being certified that, in the number of depositors
and in the aggregate amount of the deposits, there

has been an increase within the last

twelve months to be put down to the credit of the Victorian workman, to the
amount of 12 per cent, and IO1 per cent, respectively. The abstract which we
gave yesterday places the document of the commissioners in so clear a light,
that it would be a work of supereroga- tion to submit it to a renewed
analysis. Turned and shifted as they may be, the figures all tell in very
simple language of an increase in the effec- tive desire of the people to
accu- mulate, and in the surplus fund from which such accumulations accrue.
Looking at the comparative statement of the respective number of depositors in
the several savings banks in the colony, there have been added to the total
for 1863 a number amounting to 1,611, representing in money a net in- crease
of .£60,541, of which Melbourne contributes ¿55,158. AU the other centres of
deposit have exhibited a fair proportional advance, with the exception of the
gold-mining districts. In these

communities there is a check in the work of accumulation which is worth a
notice. Thus, in Ballarat there has been a falling off for the year in the
value of deposits to the amount of £117 ; in Castlemaine to the extent of
¿£818 ; and in"" Maryborough, the balance cre- dited to depositors is less in
1863 than in 1862 by £321. In other words, be- tween the three principal
mining com- munities a sum of £1,256 has been withdrawn from the local
depositories. This fact may clearly be assumed to indicate one of two things-
either the accumulative power of the people is, pro tanto, diminished, or
their general pros- perity is so much increased as to induce them to look for
more profitable invest- ments for their larger savings. The question is, to
which explanation we shall refer the phenomenon. If we could detect any co
existing class of unfavour- able circumstances that would support the
hypothesis of impaired power, the solution would be inevitable, and, how- ever
disagreeable, we must accept it. But we do not recall anything which justifies
us in coming to such a conclu- sion. As a rule, the gold-producing classes
have not given indications of any moral or physical disability during the last
twelve months, mining industry has suffered no discount, and the produc- tion
of the Victorian minos for 1863 has been only some 70,000oz. less than the
yield of the previous year. In the meantime, wages have not generally
deteriorated; there has been no extraordinary profligacy in the consumption of
them, and the cost of living has very sensibly lessened. Under these
considerations, then, the triste theory is opposed LO the logic of facts,

and we must look elsewhere for a correct interpretation of the phenomenon in
dis cussion. The falling off in deposits in the gold-fields banks happily
implies neither decreased wealth nor decreased pru- dence on the part of their
patroas. It is, in fact, a sign of generally-in- creased prosperity. It is a
sign that the realizations of the miner are large enough to enable him to
dispense with the inter- mediate agency of the small depository, and to make
direct and more profitable investments on his own account. And this suggestion
is confirmed by that table in the commissioner's report which shows the extent
of the sums withdrawn from the custody of the institutions, and withdrawn, we
may assume, for re-invest- ment in legitimate enterprises, or dis- bursement
in immigration purposes, in which the miners have expended with unusual
liberality during the past year. Another consideration, though a minor one,
offers itself, in the various rushes which have taken place to New Zealand,
Raywood, Wood'sPoint, and elsewhere, all unfavourable to the planting of
gains, and promoting a shifting and migratory state of capital It must be
remembered, in conclusion, that a savings bank is not the final resting-place
of savings, and that fluctuations in the amount of de- posits, provided the
number of depo- sitors does not fall away, is no indica- tion of diminished
business or impaired appreciation. From the very nature of the establishment,
these fluctuations must ocour periodically, as the balance due to each
individual depositor acqulros the proportion of a fund which is en

titled to be regarded as capital, and for which it would be easy for the pro-
prietor to find a ready and remunera- tive market. And it is these recurrine
abstractions of accumulated deposits that make such, a hole in the returns of
the institution, especially when it happens to be situated in a locality

favourable to speculation, and when the general demand for money in the
country at large offers a temptation for their transfer to the active arena of
business. No one who can get six per cent, for his money and unfailing se-
curity, would be content to lend it out to a depositary that only pays him
four. No doubt there was a time in the early stage of accumulation when it
suited his convenience and his policy, but that time is past the moment the
bantling has grown big enough to go out into the world by itself.

With regard to the amount of interest paid, we would not be misunderstood to
complain of its insufficiency-on the contrary, we would be disposed to cavil a
little at the disproportion which the allowance made in Victoria bears to the
allowance made by the Government savings banks in England. In England the
average interest given by the savings banks is £2 18s. 10d., or nearly one per
cent, less than the market value of money, while in Victoria the value of
money regulated by the Government de- bentures is not six per cent., and the
savings banks offer four.

In addition to that, those who would exact a high rate of interest from a
savings bank, are altogether possessed of a mistaken notion of its functions
and significance. A savings bank is not in- tended to be a resting theo for
floating capital-it is not intended to turn a class of paupers into a class of
small annuit- ants. A savings bank is itself only a compromise ; it is only
the lesser of two evils, and by no means an unmiti- gated good. It is really a
question by economists whether the amount of good it does is not fully
counter- acted by the amount of loss it en- tails. It was one of the
objections urged to the multiplication of savings banks by Mr. GLADSTONE'S
scheme for affiliating them on the post offices, that it was the extension of
a system which diverted the savings

of the multitude from a more to a less advantageous investment-from an
investment that promotes enterprise and yields profit, to an investment stag-
nant and unfruitful ; and it was a moot point whether this disadvantage was
really counterbalanced by the advantages it offered in promoting thrift among
the poorer classes. It was probably with a view to meet the objectors that the
English Legislature decided that no in- dividual depositor should receive
interest for his money when the sum amounted to .£200. But we are not disposed
to agree with the objection, for, after all, the system of accumulation is
purely a voluntary one, and every one is left free and unfettered to dispose
of his earnings as ho pleases ; but we decidedly are of opinion that to
require savings banks to pay an attractive interest would bo to defeat the
very ends of economy for which they were founded, and to convert a convenient
machinery for the collection and transfer of accumulations into a permanent
and necessarily non-productive depository for capital. As it is, they
undoubtedly

tend to promote habits of prudence ' among the class to whom they appeal ;
while in a more specious form, they would be a bar to individual enterprize.
The business of the savings bank is with the collection of the poor man's
pence, and not with the distribution of pence en- larged into pounds.
Government puts itself in a false position when it assumes the function of the
banker, and we can detect its natural jealousy and nervous- ness in
discharging its task in the re- strictions imposed on the commissioners to
limit themselves to four fields of in-

vestment-the Government securities, the Melbourne and Geelong Corpora- tions,
mortgages on real property, and the banks. The least objectionable of these
investments, inasmuch as the dis- tribution and fructification of the people's
savings is best secured through this channel, is the last. The £290,000 lent
to the banks, or, as some dull-witted persons persist in terming it, "" lying
idle"" in the banks, is probably propor- tionately more remunerative to the
country, because moro productively em- ployed, than the ¿£8,000 invested in
Melbourne and Geelong Corporation de- bentures, or the £317,000 disposed of in
Victorian Government debentures. It is true that the aggregate reserve fund of
the savings banks entitles them to pay even more than four per cent, for
deposits ; but this fact only represents in an aggravated form the loss
sustained by individual enterprise* It is nothing less than an abstraction pro
tanto from the working-fund of the nation, a withdrawal from its trading
capital of a sum that should be in the hands of industry, and which its
natural proprietors should be encouraged

to utilize for themselves. In other words, where there is such a demand for
money, and so many lucrative fields for its investment, the Government, while
it offers security to the prudence of tho labouring man, should not cultivate
in the community a taste for hoarding, or allow individual deposits to reach
even the English standard, where the range of secure investments is narrow,
and their remuneration small, and where it is but politic to protect the
depositor against temptation.

In the Legislative Assembly, this evening Dr. Mackay will ask a question ea to
the en- trance to the lakes of Gipps Laud, and ''.raw attention to the
insecurity of the protho notary's office; Mr. Macgregor will ask a question as
to the immigration regulatlori and Mr. tOrr will suggest the reduction or
alteration of tho fees for auctioneers' licences» The consideration of the
Publicans Acta Amendment Bill, in committee, is the flxst order of the day.
Supply, Ways and Mean"", Paid Naval Forces, Beal Property Act Amend- ment Bill,
and the further consideration of the Land Bill in committee, are the orders of
the day which follow.

The match between theTJnlted English and Victorian Elevens, under Mr. ttarr
and Mr. Anderson, was Tesnmed on tHo Melbourne ground yesterday. In the course
of the day, about 2,000 people paid for admission at the gatea. The game went
ouspltltedly and well

from the commencement, and very consider- able in toi rat was manifested in
its progress. The innings of Anderson's eleven lasted from twelve o'clock
until about half-past fonr, and terminated for a total of l63 nins, or fif-
teen more than the number secured by their opponents. Lockyer wa?, the top
scorer with forty-four, whilo Clarke came next with forty. Grace male twenty-
one, »ndHayward seventeen. Ia theli- second In- nings, Parr's eleven had made
thirty, with tho loss of thrco wickets, when the stumps were drawn. Garpanter
and Cmsar wero very unfortunate, having both been bowled by ""Wills without
scoring. The game will be resumed to-day at eleven o'clock; and, should It not
be finished, will be oontinued to-

morrow.

The following is the programme of mude to be performed by the band on the St.

His Excellency tho Governor proceeds to- day on his first visit to Castlemaine
and Sandhurst. Considerable preparation is being made in both boroughs to give
him a cordial reception. At Castlemaine, triomphal arches have been erected.
His Excellency will bo received at the station by the authorities, and
conveyances will be in waiting for the Viceregal party. A public dinner will
be given by the Corporation in honour of the event. The day will be observed
as a general holiday.

The business at the weekly meeting of the City Council ycäterday was
unimportant, and was disposed of in about an hour. A proposition in favour of
having a hill pre paied to consolidate the whole of the laws rehting to the
corporation was postponed for a week, for the purpose of receiving a
communication from the Corporation of Geelong, in reply to a rcjueit that they
should bear half the expones of drafting- the bill, as the laws applicable to
the one cor- poration apply also to the other. Tho town clerk reporled that
the Attoraoy-General had intimated that if such a bill were prepared it would
be passed along with the other con- solidating bills at present before the
Legis- lature.

A deputation from the Eltham District Bead Boatd, consisting of Mr. Stooke,
the cLaiiman, Mr. Wingrove, the secretary, and Mr. Lcvick, waited upon the
Commis Bkroer of Bailroads aud Roads yesterday, to lequest the Government to
construct a road over a swamp, called St. Paul's Creek, at the extremity of
the Yarra Flati, It was repre- sented that the work was ncce3saTy in ordor io
form a communication with the road to fche Jordan, and that it came properly
within t e sphere of Government, although the creek in question was within tho
boundaries of the Eltham Boad Board District. Mr. Grant ttattd that tho Local
Government Act cast the work upon the road board, and that ho had no power to
assist them.

We nnderstaad that Mr. Edward James Hogg is no longer a candidate for the
Southern Province. Another candidate ap- pears in the field, in tho parson of
Mr. William Taylor, of Overnewton, whose address to the electors appears in
the present issue of The Argus.

By theAldinga, we havo our files from Ade- laide to the 4th instant.

In the Legislative Council this evening, Mr. S. G. Henty will ask a question
as to the marine snrvey of the coast. Mr. Robertson will move for a copy of
the conditions under ?which new and forfeited runs havo been dis- posed of by
auction. Mr. Fawkner will bring in a bill to incorporate the contributors to
hospitals and other obaritablo bodies. The Industrial Schools Bill will come
on for the 'third reading; and the Consolidation Bills are among the orders of
the day.

The committee for the relief of sufferers by the lite floods will meet this
afternoon, at Ihe Town hall, at three o'clock.

A cricket match was played on Saturday .last between the Essendon and
Flemington and the Press Clubs, on the ground of tho former. Some interest was
taken in this match, as it may be remembered that in a former match between
these clubä the Press disposed of their opponents for the very small score of
fonr runs. On Saturday, however, the result was very different, for the local
club easily defeated their opponents. The Bcores were-Essendon, ninety-eight,
to which J. Madden contributed thirty one, and Hewitt fourteen; the Press,
forty, of which fourteen were made by Shepherd. A match was played on Saturday
last, on the Richmond ground, between the Becond eleven of the Richmond
Cricket Club and the Lonsdale Cricket Club, in which tho latter were defeated
by one run. Lonsdale, sixty-one ; Richmond, sixty two.

We yesterday recorded the fact of the open- ing services held on Sunday last
at the new Wesleyan chapel at Emorald hill. The fol- lowing additional
particulars may be interest- ing. The style of architecture adopted is Gothic,
of the early geometric period. Al- though ostensibly scatod for only 550 per-
sons, the arrangements aro so good that at least 900 managed to crowd in on
Sun- day evening wlthont much trouble, the ""capital ventilation preventing any
incon- venience on that score. Tho total cost may be set down at £¿,453,
exclusive of £320, ad- ditional expense incurred in consequence of the great
storms of Decembor last. The building contract was taken for £1,964, that for
seating £279, that for the gallery for £150, and that for gas fitting for £60;
other expenses make np the total cost to about £2,893. This evening a tea
meeting will he held in the local Mechanics' Institute build- ing, in
commemoration of the event.

The Fitzroy bench, of magistrates, com- posed of Messrs. J Prince, J. Levy, G.
B. Hailes, S. Donovan, and Dr. Haddon, ad- ministered a rather sharp rebuke to
the local police yesterday morning, under the follow- ing circumstances :-Mrs.
Sarah Francis was on Saturday last given in charge by a Miss Maria Boltz, for
having wilfully broken the Windows and otherwise damaged the property of the
latter. She, with her o ohild'ren, were then taken into custody, and so re-
mained till yesterday morning. It then transpired that Miss Boltz was living
with Mrs. Francis's husband. His wife, between her desertion and a keen sense
of other wrongs, felt much exasperated against her rival, and hearing her
husband's voice in Miss Boltz's house, lost her self-control, and forth- with
smashed the windows. The Bench, con- sidering Mrs. Francis's two days'
imprison- ment, fined her 14s. or two hours' confinement. The money was not
paid, and the poor

woman was liberated in the course of the

morning. The Bench expressed an opinion that the police, knowing all the
parties con- cerned, and also the peculiar circumstances of the case, might
have saved Mrs. Francis  

from the shame and suffering of two days and two nights in the watchhouse.

At the Prahran Police Court, yesterday, Elizabeth Goodwin sued J. Lane for £5
5s., for board and lodging for his child. The de- fendant did not repudiate
the claim, but pleaded his inability to pay it at present. The Bench ordered
the money to be paid ; the amount to be recovered by distress, or in de-
fault, defendant to suffer twenty-one days'

imprisonment. Messrs. Dunlop and Edwards, complained against for obstructing
the foot- path by exposing goods outside their premises 'for sale, were fined
in the mitigated penalty of 1s. Mr. W. Templeton, P.M., and Messrs. Crews and
Pilley, were the magistrates in

attendance

The question of the removal of the toll-bar on the Oakleigh and Mulgrave Road,
which has formed the subject of two or three depu- tations to the Railways and
Roads depart- ment, was again brought under the attention of the head of the
department yesterday, by a deputation from the local board, introduced by Mr.
L. L. Smith M.L.A. Mr. Grant pro- mised to authorise the removal of the toll-
bar either to Head's Gully or to a point near the Melbourne Hunt Hotel and
also to sanc- tion such reduction of the tolls as might be agreed upon by the
various boards interested in them.

In the Equity Court yesterday, Mr. Justice Molesworth heard the remaining
portion of the insolvency case of In re Cyrus Hewitt and the Insolvency Acts,
and reserved his judge- ment. He also heard the ecclesiastical case of In the
Administration of the Estate of Lench (alias Corbett),] deceased, granted to
P. A, C. O'Farrell, and reserved his judgement.

At Hockin's Hotel, last night, the usual monthly meeting of the United
Australian Benefit Society was hold. After the minutes of the last meeting had
been read and con- firmed, the secretary introduced the following declaration
to be subscribed to by members upon admission :-"" 1. I hereby declare, having
elected Australia as the land of ' my adoption, I shall use all means in my
power to advance its prosperity and greatness. 2. I pledge myself to
encourage, by example and otherwise, the use and adoption of native in-
dustries. 3. I also promise to discourage the elements of sectarian discord or
petty nationalities amongst my fellow Austra-

lians.""

At Heidelberg Polka Court yesterday, before Mr. Warburton Carr, P.M., E. Davis
summoned J. Johnson, of Greensborough, for £2 16s., for goods sold and
delivered. Verdict for plaintiff,£2 16s. and 2s.6d. costs. Defendant was
offered six weeks to pay it in ; this he de- clined, and in default of
payment, the Bench ordered him one month's imprisonment.

A correspondent writes that several miners' rights have been applied for for
the new quartz reef discovered on the Greensborough Farmers Common. As much as
two miles of

country is already marked out in claims,

the reef being in continuation of that on Dr. Phipps's property, now being
very success- fully worked.

The resident surgeon to the Lying-in Hos- pital reports as follows for the
month ending 29th ultimo: -Remaining in hospital at date, 33 ; admitted in
month, 36 ; out-patients in month, 210; now cases in month, 114.

A burglary was committed on Saturday night, at the store of Messrs. Yorke
Brothers, No. 7 Little Lonsdale-street east. Three boxes inside the store were
broken open, and their contents were found thrown about the floor. Whether
anything was taken cannot be at present ascertained, as the owner of the boxes
is not in town. The mode of entrance was by wrenching the lock off the front
door with a ""jemmy,"" which was afterwards found on the premises.

At Essendon Police Court yesterday, John Somers was charged with driving a mob
of unbroken cattle through tho borough within the proscribed hours. He was
fined 10s., and

5s. costs.

Yesterday, at the Sandridge Police Court, before Mr. F. Call, P.M., E. F.
Lakeman, master of the barque Chance, was sued by William Burnes for £6 19s.
4d. wages. Com- plainant, under the alias of John Ruffe, shipped at the
Mauritius as cook on board the Chance. On arriving at this port, Captain
Lakeman made no demur to giving Burnes his discharge or yet paying him his
wages, subject to certain deductions. On applying for his discharge at the
Government shipping office, at Sandridge, Burnes gave his real name Instead of
Ruffe, the name under which he had shipped, and as this created a difficulty,
the matter was referred to the head office in Melbourne. Ere a reply was
received, how- ever, he took out the present summons against Captain Lakeman.
The case was set- tled without any formal decision, it being un- derstood that
complainant was to receive his wages and discharge on application. Christina
Seizman, complained against by Margaret Bremner for making use of disgustingly
abusive language, was fined 10s., and 10s., 6d. costs, or seven days'
imprisonment. An al- most similar complaint was preferred by Jessie Coulthard
against Margaret Burke; the defendant was fined 5s., and cautioned against
such unseemly conduct for the future. Elizabeth Stacey sued her husband, John
Stacey, for support. The defendant had not only heaped insult on his wife by
going away and living with another woman, but had also added injury by strip
ping the house of all the furniture and leav- ing complainant perfectly
destitute, and, moreover, with a baby at the breast. The Bench ordered
defendant to pay 12s. a week towards the support of his wife, and to find one
surety of £20 for his fulfilment of the order for six months. Robert Hunter,
charged with removing sand from Crown land, was fined 10s., and 5s. costs.
George Manning, a sailor, charged with drunkenness, was set at liberty on
payment of 2s. 6d., cost

of cab hire.

A sermon was preached on Sunday morn- ing last, at Christ Church, St. Kilda,
by the Right Rev. Bishop Patteson, on behalf of the Melanesian Mission. The
collection, with some small addition in the evening, amounted to £45 10s. 6d.

An inquest was held yesterday, at the Mel- bourne Hospital, by the city
coroner, upon the body of Joseph Bayes, a gardener, aged forty years, who died
on Sunday. Deceased, it appears, was addicted to intemperance, and after
spending a week at the house of a friend, was removed to the hospital, at the
end of last week, in consequence of an illness, brought on by hard drinking.
Ho died on Sunday morning in an epileptic fit. Dr. Robertson having made a
post mortem examination of the body, said death had resulted from serous
apoplexy, adding, that deceased had told him he had, previous to his illness,
been drunk four days on colonial ale. On this the jury found that death was
caused by serous apo- plexy, brought on by intoxication.

Our Geelong correspondent informs us that the body of a male infant child was
found on the western beach of that town yesterday morning. The body was
considerably decom- posed, and appeared to have been wrapped up in calico and
thrown into the sea. The throat had been cut, and it is supposed the back part
of the head had been beaten in

also.

A man named Frederick Wilkinson was killed in Geelong on Saturday last, near
the residence of the Hon. J. F. Strachan. The deceased, who was about thirty-
two years of age, and in the employment of Mr. John Olive, was returning home
from town when the horses he was driving bolted, and he was thrown out, the
wheels of the waggon passing over his body. An inquest was held on the body
yesterday, and a verdict of ""Accidental death"" returned.

The anniversary meeting of the Royal Soclety for the election of officers was
held last evening, but in consequence of insuffi- cient attendance it was
adjourned until Mon-

day evening next. It is to be hoped that there will then be a better
attendance. The nominations of candidature for office are as follow
:-President, Mr. O. W. Ligar, Dr. Mueller, and Professor M'Coy ; vice-
presidents, Mr. Gillbee and Dr. Bleasdale ; treasurer, Mr. W. H. Archer and
Mr. A. K. Smith ; librarian, Mr. Stutzer ; custos of collection, Dr. Macadam
and Mr. W. H. Archer ; secretary, Mr. Ellery ; members of council, E. Von
Guerard, Dr.   Barker, Mr. D'O. H. Aplin, Mr. T. Rawlings, and Mr. E. G.
Fitzgibbon. The retiring mem- bers of council are Dr. Wilkie, Professor M'Coy,
Dr. Mueller, and Messrs. C. A. Ligar, W. H. Archer, and A. Selwyn. The
remaining members of council are Sir W. Stawell, Mr. J. O'Shanassy, Dr.
Bleasdale, and Messrs. Gillbee, Fitzgibbon, A. K. Smith, Ellery, and

Christie.

A case of supposed suicide occurred at Sandridge yesterday. Between four and
five o'clock in the morning a sailor on board the barque Robert Passenger
observed a female precipitated, either by accident or intent, from the town
pier into the water. He, along with another man, immediately procured a boat,
but just as the boat was about a couple of lengths from the women, she
suddenly dis- appeared. The body was discovered floating on the water, near
the railway-pier, about three o'clock in the afternoon, and is sup- plied to
be that of a woman lately residing

at Emerald-hill.

The committee of the New Hebrides Mission, and a number of clergymen and
friends, met yesterday forenoon, at the Rev. I. Hetherington's church,
Collins-street, for the purpose of receiving the missionaries who have lately
arrived by the missionary schooner Day Spring, from Nova Scotia, en route to
the sphere of their labours in the South Sea Islands. The meeting was also
convened for the purpose of making arrange- ments for a public reception of
the mission- aries, and for meetings, at which they might be present, to be
held afterwards. The Rev. Dr. Cairns occupied the chair, and after a   few
remarks on the objects of the meeting, introduced the Rev. John Geddie, who
has recently arrived from Aneiteum, after la- bouring in the mission cause
there for sixteen years. A brief but very interesting account of this island
was given by Mr. Geddie, who mentioned that the na- tives when he first
arrived there were in a state of gross heathenism, but that now the population
were all professing Christians. Mr. Geddie also gave an outline of the opera-
tions of the New Hebrides Missions, and of the part to be taken in them by the
mission- aries proceeding by the Day Spring. He also exhibited the two axes
with which Mr. Gordon, the missionary, and his wife, were massacred some time
ago in Erromanga, one of the islands of the group. Some discussion took place
as to the number of meetings, and the districts in which they should be held ;
but after a variety of suggestions had been made and discarded, it was finally
agreed to place the entire control of all the arrangements in the hands of a
committee, consisting of the Revs. George Mackie, W. Miller, J. P. Sunder-
land, J. Clarke, and the missionaries them- selves. The arrangements made by
the com- mittee will be announced by advertisement. The names of the
missionaries proceeding in the Day Spring to the New Hebrides are-the Rev.
Donald Morrison, the Rev. Wm. M'Cul- loch, and the Rev. J. D. Gordon. The last
named gentleman is brother of Mr. Gordon, the missionary who was killed.
Captain and Mrs. Frazer, Mrs. Morrison, and Mrs. M'Cul- loch, accompany the
missionaries.

As a proof of the prolific nature of the pre- sent fruit season, the
Castlemaine Daily News,

of last evening, mentions the fact that Mr. Hirschi, of the Mount Alexander
Gardens, has already sold about seven tons of peaches, and he has a
proportionately large quantity   of other descriptions of fruit.

There was another full house at the Theatre Royal last evening, the tragedy of
"" King John,"" with the new set of characters, being repeated. The chief scenes
of the piece were received with immense applause.

WHAT EVERY FARMER SHOULD KNOW. The regular use of Sykes's Drench at calving
time ensures a perfectly healthy herd. Your mind is relieved of the worrv of
bad cleansing, milk fever, mammitis and kindred (roubles which occur at
calving time if von methodically drench each cow at this particular period
with Sykes's Drench. Thoughtful dairymen who work to obtain (lie maximum <d
profit from their dairy herds know from practical experience that it pays to
dren< li each cow with Svkcs's Drench after calving. Neglect to use this
proved remedy at calving time leads to expense, and expenses are profits lost,
so that in your own interests it will pay ton to commence this season with
Svkcs'.-. J irench. Sold by all stores at 1 7 a dn.'.on or 1/6 a packet. Each
pa>k>i contains two drenches. Mr. E. Griffiths, the well- known Jersey Breeder
of Taranaki. says:- ""To be successful with cows they must be kept healthy. I
