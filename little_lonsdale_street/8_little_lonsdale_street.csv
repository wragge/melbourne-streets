The City. — The adjourned revision court, to hear objections against electors
for St. James division of West Melbourne for the Legislative Assembly, was
held yesterday afternoon at the City Court, before Messrs. Call. O'Brien. Cur-

tain, and Dr. McCarthy. There were sixty-four objections lodged to names in
this list by Mr. W. B. Stephens, ex-registrar, and service was proved only by
delivery; and in some of the cases the notices had not been served upon the
parties objected to, notably in twelve instances, although the registrar, Mr.
Ford, had duly advertised the objections as if they had been properly served.
This course was commented upon by Mr Call as being irregular, and he cen-
sured Mr. Stephens and Mr. Ford for the manner in which the list of objections
had been compiled. Many of the names objected to were struck, out, in
consequence, of the i non- attendance of the parties. Mr. J. G. Albury,
superintendent of the Sailors' Home, was ob- jected to by Mr. Stephens, who
stated that, when he served the notice at the Home he made inquiries, and was
informed by some person— he did not know , by, whom — that Mr. Albury did not
reside at the Home. Mr. Burke, who appeared to oppose the objec- tion, asked
Mr. Stephens from whom he made his inquiries, and his answer was that he went
into the Institution and learned that Mr. Albury was not known in the Home.
Mr. Burke took exception to the form of delivery of notice, but the Bench
overruled the objection, remarking that they had to take the statement of Mr.

Stephens. Mr. Albury was placed in tbe wit- ness-box, and stated that it was
evident that proper inquiries had not been made, as he had been in the Home
since its foundation, and had always resided on the premises. The Bench did
not consider that the objection was valid, but frivolous; and were gled, upon
dismissing it, that they able to award Mr. Albury 10s. 6d. costs, which is to
be paid by Mr. Stepbcns! Similar facts were adduced in the case of John
Hawkins, steward at the Home; and that was also dismissed, with 10s. 6d.
costs. There had been a third objection lodged at the Home to the name of
Thomas John Richards, which Mr. Stephens wished to withdraw, but attention was
called by Mr. Moses Alexander to the fact that the man was actually out of the
district, and consequently ought to be struck off the roll. This case was
postponed until next Thursday, for the purpose of receiving evidence. Twelve
other names objected to were not removed until further particulars had been
produced to show that they were still resident in the district.—Mr. Warman,
registrar for St. Patrick's and St. Mary's division, had objected to a number
of voters for both the Legislative Council and As sembly; and in the case of
William Thompson Burton, who had been struck off the Council list on the
previous day, the Court on hearing Mr. Burton's statement, that he had not
parted with his qualification in the province, but merely changed his
residence from the Western Port hotel to the Hall of Commerce shades, ordered
his name to be replaced on the list. There were several voters in attendance

who had been objected to by Mr. Warman for the Legislative Assembly ; but as
Mr. Warman had withdrawn these objections, their cases were not heard. Their
names were Patrick Burns, Flagstaff Hill ; Charles Gilliheavey, Treasury
hotel; Tbomas Haggarty, Flagstaff Hill; and Jno. Ryan, 8 Little Lonsdale
street. The Court then adjourned until Thursday. Hawthorn. — A full bench of
magistrates sat yesterday to revise the electoral lists far the Boroondara and
Nunawading divisions of tho Central and South Provinces, and the electoral
district of South Beurke. In the Boroondara' (B) list for the Central
Provinco, seven names objected to by the registrar, on account of non-
residence and loss of qualification, wero struck off.' Sixteen names were
objected to ""on tbo Boroondara (A) list for the South Province. Four of these,
who claimed as ministers of religion, were objected to by Alfred Morris. Three
of them failed to appear, and their names were struck off. Tho fourth, Mr.
John Padbury, appeared in support of his claim, and bended in o preachers'
plen of tbo United Methodist Free Church, to show that 'hewasa recognised
minister of that denomination. ' The objection urged was that tbo claimaut,
who is bu undertaker hy trade, wos a local preacher

my, ana nor n minister in - tne ordinary accep tation of tho term. The
claimant admitted that be was not authorised to soienmnlse marriages, although
be administered the -sacraments in his turn; and on account of that
disability,: tbe Bonch held that he was not entitled to have his name upon
tiie roll as a minister. Of the other objections one wos withdrawn, and tbe
rest were"", sustained. In. the Boroondara (A) list for the Assembly eight
names were struck . out oh account of non -residence; and five were token off
the'Boroondara (B) list for the snine reason. Three objections were made to
names on the Nunawading list for tbe Assembly, on the ground of the claimants
being under twenty- one years of ego, and one for non-residence. None of the
claimants appeared, and their names' were struck out."" The
Bendlgq'Advartlscrseyc— ""A tush, which ibis to fas hoped will turn out oi soma

up their courage to defy lite Legislative Council on tho Tariff amalgamated
with tho Appropriation Bill. Tito two mea-

sures roneu into one jinvc at Jcngiu seen the light in printed form. And the
Legislative Assembly will bo called upon this evening to deal with the
combined bill, prior to its being sent up to tho Council. It lias for somo
time past been doubted whether Mr. M'Cor,Locn and his colleagues meant to
enrry out their threat of attempting to coerce the Council into passing lite
measure, by throwing upon tho latter tho responsibility of ""stepping the
supplies"" for the service of the year. And the Ministry seemed to countenanco
this doubt by their speech- and conduct of Into in reference to the
proceeding. This, however, it now ap pears, wns a ruse to elicit outside
opinion on _ tho question. And they scctn after weighing tho evidonco thus
obtained, to have at last made up their minds that it would be less damaging
to risk tho defeat of their measure, than to withdraw

from tho attitude of menace and defiance which they had taken up towards the
Council. They shrunk from the ridtculo and contempt, which would have been
poured upon their heads had they obeyed their own craven instincts and sent up
the tariff sepnrate from tho Appropriation Bill. And they have ac cordingly,
in sheer desperation, tacked tho two bills together to meet one and tho same
fato. They linvc not, however, been altogether insensible to tho objec tions
which have been urged, both on grounds of constitutional prooedure and of
expediency, against the wilful and un provoked course of aggression against
the rights and functions of tho Legislative Council, to which they ltavo so
rashly committed themselves. And they try to meet these objections in their
own pecu liar way. In order to cajole tho Council into doing that which they
found threats were not likely to 'accomplish, namely the passing of tho
conjoint measure, they havo inserted a clause — tho nineteenth and last — -to
tho effect that tho Act is only to continue in force up to the 20th of
January, 18G8 — that is for three yeurs from the first date of tho collection
of the new duties. By making thus a measuro of comparatively tempo rary
duration, they hope to wheedle the Upper House into agreeing to tho bill and
passing it into law. Liko the in genious lady, who excused the fruit of her

illiU"" (JliU) kiUu ill tiUlihvCJt 111.11113 01 J hope to propitiate the
Legislative Coun cil in favour of their unconstitutional bantling, by
announcing it as only a small trespass upon legitimate legislation for a
couple of years or so, at tho utmost. Tricky, cunning, and craven to tho last,
they strive to carry their point by miser able petty shifts of this kind, of
which bold minds and masculine intelligence would bo ashamed. But we are
greatly mistaken if thoy find any small ma noeuvres of this sort will avnil
them, in any wise. The Legislative Council are not to ho duped quite so easily
as Messrs.M'Cui,- locii and Af icitiE imagine. The members of tho Councilsee
that the violence done to their status, as a co-ordinate branch of the
Legislature, by this measure of three years' duration, is just as great, as
offen sive, dud as unconstitutional, as if the measure were to last for all
time. Tho misconduct of the Ministry in this matter consists in their having
recourse

to a proceeding wmcn aims tic lorcmg ino Legislative Council to pass into law
a system of Customs duties, without the Council exercising its constitutional
right of deliberating upon that system. That is delinquency, number one. Tho
special mode of coercion is delinquency, number two ; and it consists of
throwing upon tho Council the responsibility of rejecting the Appropriation
Bill, which provides the means of sustaining the credit of tho country and
meeting the Government ex penditure of the current year ; unless they consent
to pass that bill in conjunction with n tariff upon which they are not to be
at liberty to pronounco an opinion or

cxerciso an independent; voio and ine right of unfettered decision. Neither
the one nor tho other of these delinquencies is reduced in heinousncss by the
trick of making the act of legislation, which is meant to be the monument of
the Council's humiliation, a measure of only three years', duration. Ministers
however have .thought that it would bo a good card to try the effect of making
the act temporary. But the Council cannot be deceived as to the true bearings
of the caso by such a triek. Judging by their own craven souls tho Ministry
liavo imagined that tho Council would shrink from the bold and decisivo courso
of throwing out the sup plies for the year, and that rather than incur that
responsibility they would sur render their own privileges, and abdicate their
own functions as an independent branch of tho Legislature. And to get an
additional chance of success- they linvo tried the "" temporary"" trick. But
Messrs. M'Culloch and colleagues will find that they have been out in their
reckoning ; that tho Council will not hesi-

tate to throw out the amalgamated bill, oven though in so doing, they have to
stop tho supplies voted for tho maintenance of the public service. Further
too' they will find that the ' paltry move of making their tariff a measuro of
only threo years' duration will hut serve to add to the present indignation of
the Council, the scorn which trick and cowardice com bined, always excite.
Intemperate, foolish and unconstitutional as their first resolve was to coerce
tho Council into their views, ministers havo now in addition shown themselves
mean and shabby adopts at the tactics of thimblerig. Their triclciness in the
one case however does not oblite rate their rashness in tho oilier. And
neither the one nor the other stylo of manoeuvre will allow tho Legislative
Council to blind itself to the fact, that the violeneo offered to its
independence by tho amalgamated bill ;is equally intoler able and must bo'
.equally, repelled, whether tho measure .is .-moant' to last for threo months,
"" for three

years, or for threo hundred years. And the only way to repel the outrago is nt
once nnd without ceremony to reject the measuro tho moment it comes bcibro the
House. Tho Legislative Council will do well to boar in mind tho light in which
the whole proceeding is viewed by thclending journal of Europe— the greatest
organ of opinion in the civilised world — the London Times. They will see in
the article from which wc quoted yesterday, and which wo give to-day at full
length, that the proceeding to which the M'Culloch Ministry has in stigated
the Assembly is denounced as an "" unconstitutional and almost revolutionary
attempt of one por tion of tlio Legislature to infriugo upon the rights of
another nnd further that in the opinion of Ihe Times "" tho responsibility"" of
whntevcr results follow from that attempt, "" will rest most justly on the
heads of the Ministry"" who have planned, prompted, and carried out that ""
revolutionary"" proceeding. There is no loncrer any doubt of the intention of
the Government. The "" tack"" of ihe Appropriation Bill to the tariff is now
declared. The Pntliamenlary papers of yesterday contain nnmrirel ntXttf

Iler Majesty certain duties of customs, and for altering certain o her duties
and for applying a sum out of the Consolidated Itovenue of Victoria to the
service of the year 1865, avd for appro priating the supplies granted in thii
session of Parliament, and for other purposes.'' This bill contrins certain
customs regulations ; the second schedule comprises the tariff; and the third
the rstimntes for Ihe present year. We should imagine that Sir Francis Murphy
will at once decide that the hill is contrary to the standing orders, but
should the House decline to accept his ruling the measure will receive its
coup de grace at the hands of the Council. Tho publication of the revenue
returns for the six months ending 30th J une, affords an oppor tunity of
observing what are she actual effects of the new tariff as far as the treasury
I- con cerned. The new duties have yielded L3I),113 lets than Mr. Verdon
expected from them, while the old duties, with which he did not ioterfere,
furnished L'J3,90G in excess of this estimate. A semi-olfielnl table has been
published Dy a con- t.mporary, iu which the result of the five months since
the new tariff lias bern in force, are shown. From this it would setm that had
the old tariff been Jet alone there would have

been'LSOOO more received under it tuau air Verdon required. But how could that
gentle man have shown a deficiency ! The explana tion is now very easy. The
revenue under the- old tariff was under-estimated to the extent of L40,000 in
tho fire months, or at about 1.100,000 lor the year. The art of cooking
statistics does not seem to be an original inven tion on the part of tiie
Government organ, but appears to have been exen-ised in the first in stance by
the Government itself. We now see that there was really no necessity for the
change in tho tariff as far as the revenue was concerned, nnd whether it is
any advantage to take duties til ten and sugar and put heavier ones on to
molcskiue, ctoekeiy, brushes, salt, vinegar, and pickles, our readers are
possibly the best judges. Botli Houses of Parliament meet again this
afternoon. The Council have to deal with the Royal Mint Bill, the Public Loan
Bill, the Mining Bill, and the Imprisonment for Debt Bill ; while the
principal business to be tran sacted iu the Legislative Assembly is the second
rending of the Appropriation Bill nnd the Cus toms Duties Laws Amendment Bill.
The debate on the address to iter Majesty on the national defences will also
be resumed. A meeting of the shareholders in the Coliing- wood Gold-Mining
Company was held last evening in the Freemnsous' hotel, Smith street, Mr. John
Hood occupying the chair. There was a large attendance. The roport stated that
operations at the shaft had been stopped for want of funds. Of the new issue,
300 shares hod been taken up ; but the subsequent fallitig-off in the cnle.
was the. cause of tho want of funds. The nrlfrinnl clinreu bet no fllllv nnfil
1111 thfi rnvnntlA

was entirely dependent on the new issue, to check the sale of which was to
utterly parol) ze the operations of the directors. The present state of the
company was much to lie deplored, but the directors attributed it to the fnlse
and malicious reports industriously circulated in Co1- lingwood and Melbourne.
The report censured the action ol certain shareholders aad others in sprendiog

plant on the ground was complete, with the exception of an engine ; the assets
were valued at L128 i, while the liabilities amounted to about L1U0. The
directors recommended that work should not be resumed until 1000 shares kail

view to prevent ll.o rowdy ism which, taking plane nt meetings, had pre vented
many from joining tho company, that the meetings should be held in the-daytime
; also that efforts should be made to dispose of tit ires, or that the company

An extensive flood is feared at Sale, Accord ing to the Gippa Land 'Junes,
""the rain, which set in on the evening of ttie Olli and con tinued to fall
with scarcely a moment's cessation until- Wednesday evening, has so swollen
the rivers and creeks upon the Melbourne road that communication is
effectually stopped, and most of i)ie bridges either carried away or
destroyed. The non-arrival of the .Melbourne mail at the usual hour on
Thursday was the first intimation of the rising of the rivers, nnd the
inhabitants at once suspected that tho delay was owing to the causes above
described, but as day merged into night, and still the auxiously expected
mailman did not arrive, doubts resolved in to certainties, which tho following

Uridge, witii tho exception of a small p rtion of the centre, has been carried
away. ThcTraralgon Bridge has been carried bodily from the Trnralgon side to
the S Jo side. In consequence of this the mail contractor's agent directed
that the mailman (due on Thursday at Sale) should not attempt to cress tho
Traraigou Creek, ltbtlrgimposslhioforliim to doso without risking bis life and
the less of the mail bags. Tiie Melbourne mail from Sffe, which left on

the morning of tiie liirh, where it was obliged to ho brought over the
backwater in a tub, when the mailman proceeded ss far as the Morewcll, but on
arriving there was unable to cross the river. The mail fo# Sale was then an
the oppo-ile side, hut was obliged to return to the Moe until the following
day, when a fresh attempt would be made.' A further repot t up to Thursday
states that 'ail tho creeks are impassable,' nud the bridge over. Fllnn's

that lie may have returned to Ihe Moe. Tho flood has not yet reached Rosedalc,

informed by a person who lias just returned from a lengthened tour of 300

felt, very little rain having fallen iu some places for nearly 12 months. Both
squatters and settlers have but a dreary prospect before tliem unless rain

places tho sottlors find It necessary to employ the I blacks to cut nil the
standing gra«s to ba found in the bends of the river, ami have it carried to
the head station to feed stack or preserve it for future use. The surface of
the ground is des cribed generally to be burnt up by the long- coulinued
drought, and as indurated as nn earthen floor, while iu many places huge areas
are without a vestige of herbage of any kind. During the last two or three
weeks several mobs of cattle and floeka of sheep havo' been travelling along

Rev. Dr. Cairns, who was a passenger onboard Hie Great Britain ou her. last

suddenness of the change from the glowing warmth of our Aus tralian rummer to

the Cape, it had no terrors for us, IVu accomplished tho feat on the 10th
April, a Sabbath day; the sun wns shining brightly, the wind was loir, 'the
'sea smooth us an inland lake, or as Holisou's Bay. The South Pacific is,
indeed, a great and terrible sea — a dread immensity of water. Fur more

than we anticipated or than is at ail usual. While far to the westward of the
well kuown region of icebergs we were all at once in volved iu a dense fog.
Along with tbe fog tho temperature fell to a chilling coldness. It wns
suspected that we were in. the vicinily of ice, und soon bugo bergs loomed
through the mistlike sheeted aopnritlons from the Antarctic. This continued
for nearly 300 miles. Thoro was much anxiety felt, for iu addition to the; fog
there was the davkness of moonless nights. Bu t God mercifully preserved us,
and guided :our noble ship through these menacing dangers. In I due time wc

to our, delighted gaze. Words can convey but a very I faiut and inadequate
idea of the grandeur of tho scene. We passed about 100 in one day, varying

with one of nwe allied to fear. Let a thick rni.st 'en velope tho ' expanse,

inquiry held. The evidence was of a most extraordinary and conflicting
character as to whether the infant was really born alive or not. Every one in
the bouse, and the woman who attended the girl, swore that they heard the
child, or a child, crying in the room where the confinement occurred, but Dr.
Hallet asserts that they were mistaken, as the child was stillborn. Under
these circumstances he advised the body to be buried in the garden, but it was
subsequently interred in the Wan- garatta Cemetery. The verdict of the jury
was that the child died during birth."" At the District Court yesterday

Cured his

Kidney Trouble

After Months of Torture

Kidney Trouble is responsible for such a host of other ailments that it is a
;wise plan to take De Witt's Kidney and Bladder Pills as soon as the first
symptoms are recognised. By this simple plan

many weary months of suffering may be avoided and much money may. be saved. •

'' I was tortured by Kidney Trouble for six long months,"" writes Mr. T. E.
Bonning, 8, Little Lonsdale Street, South Geelong, ""and I tried every kind of
Pill and medicine you could mention without success. An advertise ment told me
about T>e Witt's Pills, and I am thankful to say that in a short while they
completely banished my suffering for ever.""

In most cases Kidney Trouble is first indicated by pains in the back, and
readers who experience such pains should. Mr bonning (from photo.) on no
account delay -treatment.

Read the startling proof which accompanies every box of De Witt's Pills, and
you will realise that, although so inexpensive and so easy to obtain, they
form a remedy which cannot fail to give instant relief, and quickly effect a
cure. Twelve hours after you take the first dose of De Witt's Pills yox? will
have visible, convincing proof of their .ability to cure.

DeWITT'S

Kidney Trouble

and they are also a reliable remedy for Rheumatism, Backache, Lumbago,
Sciatica, Gout, and all ailments arising from an excess of Uric Acid or
disorders of the Kidneys and Bladder, because they

remove the cause of the trouble.

That is the secret of :the success of De Witt's Pills ; that is why"" they
cured Mr.. Bonning after every other form of treatments had failed, and that
is why they will cure every suffering reader who gives them a trial.

The genuine Pills can be obtained from Chemists and Storekeepers everywhere at

operation At Lanplands Fouudry, Melbourne, Where every information can bo
obtained; and the fonpection of all parties intcetted to securing the most
efficient process of saving gold, either in the ore or tailings, is solicited.
Tlie machines are in universal use in the States of California, Nevadn,
Mootunn, etc. ; and their intro duction into Australia must be of the greatest
im portance to the mining community, as trials and testa will undoubtedly
prove. They will manipulate quartz ores stamped to n certain fineness and all
tailings moro effectually than any other process ; and by their use a large
amount of gold now lout by the processes generally followed in Australia will
be saved. Ores containing pyrites, imindic, nnd othor base metals, can be
successfully treated by Wheelers Patent P ins, thereby rendering it profitable
to work mines that havo been abandoned on account of the supposed poverty ot
the yield. Tailings may in many cases also be re-worked by this process to
great advuntage. Teste of ores and tuillngs ore made by Wheeler's Patent Pane,
and n amnll battery of stamps at the works, at Langlonds' Foundry. For terms
