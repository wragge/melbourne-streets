About 11.30 o'clock en Saturday night Joseph Gardiner, James Evans, John Greed
and Leonard Williamson, after having fish in Jamell Maccasa's premises, No. 4,

Little Lonsdale Street, refused to pay. They tried to dash away but they were

fight between the parties occurred. The quart ette were driven into the supper
room and Maccasa and his assistant heat them back with firewood. The men
eventually made their escape through the crowd which had been attracted by the
noise of the conflict. Gardiner, Evans and Williamson, present ed a sorry
spectacle, for their faces and hands were covered with blood. They were
treated at the Melbourne Hospital. Wil liamson had a bruised and flattened
skull but the other men sustained nothing worse than outs on theHead. Hood had
his ear lobe cut open by a blow from a clenched fist, but the proprietor
escaped with slight- injuries. tfust after the row terminated Constables Fryes
and QtKalm arrived and later arrested the whole of the men on charges of
assault.

Mr Hinrichsen, his wife and three children were walking along. the footpath in

the direction of Brighton Beach. Mr Hinriclhsen called out'to the man to get
off the path, but he took no notice, and redo past them, The little child was
toddling along about a yard in the rear, and as the father turned his head to
see where she was, he heard a scream, and saw that the child had been knocked
down and was lying with the bicycle on top of her. The rider was also
sprawling on the ground. When picked up the child was found to be bleeding
from a deep wound over the left eye, where she had evidently been struck by
the pedal of the machine. Mr Hinrichsen detained the man, and a gentlenan who
was passing in a trap drove the injured child and her mother to the surgery of
Dr. Backhouso, who found i -necessary to place two stitches in the wound. The

Thk rejxirt of the South Australian commissioners regarding Dr. Danysz's
method of rabbit destruction, which wo published in our last issue, practi
cally asserts that the experiments which have been carried on 011 Brough ton
Island tyave been a total failure. We have, of course, yet to wba.t Dr. Danvsz
mav have to sav to the

inaiiy nnfavoi'able statements whicji it contains, but as some are (juestions
of fact it is not likely that any satisfac tory answer vvill be ^orthcoii)ing
to | tbose. Dr. J)anysz underi^uk I (.0 carry out bis experiments in the first
place it Has demanded by the I people of Australia as a whole that j there
should be no risk of any possible kind whatever to human beings. To ensure
that all kinds of animals were to be tried with the virus, and yet | dogs,
cats and pigeons were not in oculated, but even were not to bo found 011 the
island during the cur rency of the experiments. The wild animals of Australia
were [represented by three kangaroos, and the domestic ones by a fe.w horses,
cattle, sheep, pigs, i^nd poultry. These were inoculated once and came uo harm
; but that, the .commissioners poiut out, is far from being conclusive, as the
trials should be repeated at various times, at different different stagos of
the animals' exist ence- Such a contention is (jnite feasible, and it is to be
noticed that all Dr. Danysz claims is not that the trials are conclusive, but
they are ' very reassuring.' Certainly so far as they go they do support his
side of the case, but before allowing the adoption of the system generally on
the main land, the public of Australia will require something a great deal
more satisfactory than what is merely i.' very reassuring.' But if such do
mestic aninnls as cat- and dog have not been experimented upon, there is only
one conclusion to come to, and that is that the experiments made so far have
been merely a waste of time.

It would seem, therefore, that wo aui now ju^l us far off a satisfactoiy solu
tion of the rabbit ditliculty as we were 12 months ago. Dr. Danysz, befoi* be
left went so far as to claim that his svstem would be the means of dfictia**
ing the number of rabbit* considerably und he does not contend that it will be
fatal to all which eonio in contact with those affected, as many of Ins suppor
ters hoped would be the case. As a matter of fact, according to Dr John son
and Air. Giddings, 10 per cent, of Hut rabbits out of the small nuinbor ot
,120 011 the island became immune to the virus in two months. In « '»,,ch
larger number of rodents to be dca t with the percentage would probably b«
much larger. It would seem, therefore, that the only way the rabbit pest will
ever lie materially reduced will be by the country Incoming more settled ami
populated and the demand for the animal and its fur increasing, 'lhat will
lead to more people devoting their attention to the industry, and in the
course of time perhaps reducing the pest to buch limits that it can be coped
with by the landowners. In New South Wales there is no hope of dealing with
tho pest in any other way Now that it has been almost conclu sively shown that
the Danysz methods are impracticable. In Victoria the task of keeping them
down has proved beyond the powers of the landowners without assistance from
rabbit trup Frs, and in a country like New South Wales, where the pest is many
times worse than it is here, it can be ima gined that the operations would
have to be very much more extensive than here, l)r. Danysn has not proved
satisfactorily that there is no danger to domestic animals by his method, and
even if it were established beyond doubt that it is effective with mbbits, its
use would not be allowed until the firstnamed condition was complied with.

INQUEST.-On Friday last, Nicholas M'Oul lon, a carter, residing at North
Melbourne, was on his way home, when he was seized with violent spasmodic
pains of the bowels and chest. He called on Mr. Kingsland, a chemist and
druggist, who administered the necessary medicines, and sent him home in a
conveyance. He grew worse, until eleven o'clock on the following night, when
he expired. An in quest was held on the body yesterday, before

Dr. Wilmot, and the jury returned a verdict to the effect that deceased had
died from natural causes, and that had proper medical aid been sent for in
time, in all probability, life would have been spared.

STARRING. On Saturday evening a man in the employment of Mrs. Turner of the
Ravenswood Hotel, had driven a cart into Sandhurst, which was standing at the
door of the Black Swan Hotel, when Mr. B. Burrowes accused the driver of being
drunk, and found fault with him for having over-driven the horse. The fellow
retorted in an insolent manner, when Mr. Burrowes told him that he would drive
the cart home himself, and jumped in for the purpose of doing so. The man also
got into the cart and attempted to take the reins from Mr. Burrowes. A scuffle
ensued between them, which was put an end to by some person dragging the man
from the cart. He then drew his knife, and cut one of the traces through. On
Mr. Burrowes interfering to prevent him he made a stab at him with the knife,
which Mr. Burrowes par-

ried with his hand, receiving a severe cut on  the knuckles. The ruffian was
given in charge to the police and is now in the look up. We understand he is a
foreigner. Bend

THE EASTERN PROVINCE ELECTION This contest was decided by the polling on
Monday, but up to the present time we have only heard the result of the ballot
at two stations,

Beechworth and Wangaratta. Mr. Highett 1 is at present very far a head, and
the general impression is that he will be the successful ! candidate. At
Beechworth 49 votes ward ' recorded, of which 38 were in favour of Mr Highett,
and 11 for Dr. Gemmell. At Watt garage, 17, of which Mr. Highett obtained 5,
old his opponent 12. This leaves a majority of 21 at present in favour of Mr.
Highett, taking into consideration the small number of votes which are likely
to have been recorded

at the other polling places throughout  the province, the odds are certainly
dead ' again the doctor.- Ovens Constitution- '

ELTHAM, Adjoining the Government Tnwnsliip of El- tham, on the Yarra River.
Half acre allotments for sale in the above township. At Thirty-five shillings
each. Title — A Grant from tho Crown to the Vendor. THE advertiser feels
persuaded that to re commend the above property lie need only state the three
following undeniable facts— 1st— The Diamond Creek, which yields a never
failing supply of the purest water, running through the whole lenRth of the
township. 2nd — The boundury of the Government township reserve was fixed
years hack, when Melbourne itself was not ex pected to rise beyond n mere
villnge, and when the valuable building ground of Collingwood was sold in
allotments containing about twenty seven acres each. 3rd — Immediately beyond
the Government township the hank of the|Yarra is so steep that water could
with difficul'y be obtained from the river, making it certnin that the town
will extend itself in the direction of the Creek. The distance from Melbourne
is about 1 1 miles in a straight line, and betwean 13 and 14 miles by road.
Attention is particularly directed to the following, being the second article
in the c inditions of Bale — ""That, to secure to the purchaser unin- ter.upted
possession without the ex pense of a deed, an attested copy on parchment of
the Crown Grant, with the vendor's receipt for the purchase money on the same
sheet, will be given to each purchaser without charge."" A plnn is nbw on view,
And the Lots oan be ohosen at ' once Application tu be made to J. M. HOLLOWAY,
"" RED BOOT,"" SWANBTON STREET, Opposite the Shepherd's Arms. N.B. — A plan of
the property will be given to each purchaser. 412 MR. PENROSE NEVINS, LAND AND
ENOINEBR1NO SUBTBZOR, For the satisfaction of those parties to whom Mr Nevins
may not be personally known, he begs to state that he was regularly educated
for tho profession of surveyor, having beon articled In 1834 for five years to
Messrs Wil liam fuhnson and Son, the eminent surveyors of Manchester, since
which time lie has been in the practice of h's profession in Manchester, That
during this Interval he lias had the ad vantage of being professionally
connected with most of the eminent engineera of th- d»y — Meesas Brunei,
Stephenson, Locke, Sir John Hennie, Stc. — in the railway and other
engineering works which have been recently constructed in England. Mr Nevins,
in addition to the ordinary routine of a surveyor's practice In tills colony,
will be happy to undertake the Formation or RKSKRVoma and other engineering
works which the enhanced value of stations that separation from Sydnoy is
likely to occasion, will shortly he found to be profitable. Mr Nevins begs to
stato further that it is his intention at every Government Land Sale to follow
the plan ho adopted at the last oovbrnment land salb, viz., to allow an
inspection of the plans with out any chnrge, so that his office will he found
a desirable medium to all parties inter ested in the Government land Sales.

necessary to be . done in forming the various rights of way in the City of
Melbourne. 10th February, 1851. The natural soil is to be reduced or made up,
as the case m»y require, so that the lun- gitiidiual scet'On of the whole
right i f woy hall in no pa.t have an inclination of less than 1 In 120 i and
wherevrr practicable, the entire length is to form one lnollne. In laying on
any stuff it is to be spread in layers of not more than 1 font thick. The
tronvtrse section of the right of way is to show a roadway whose o.own shall
be 1 inoh above the kerbs of the foolwaye, and the fall from the crown to the
water channels, Is to be at the rate of 1 In 25. On cither eide of the roadway
there is to he & water channel 18 Inches wide, consist- fng of two rows of
bluestone pitchers 0 Inches deep, and not less than 0 indies by 14 Inches on
the surface, with upright tides, sit In loam, and rammed with a rammer
weighing 40lbi, so as to subside 4 Inches. The bottom of the channel is to be
7 Inches below the ton of the kerbi. On either eide of the roadway there Is
alio to be a footway not less than 8 feet wide, and these are to be separated
from the roadway by a r.d gum plank or kerb 10x8, est on edge, and fastened
with 8 inoh spikes to piles 4 x 4 of red gum, 3 feel long, driven Into the
soil. The footways are to be covered with a coat of gravel 3 inches thick, and
the surface is to fall towards tile diannel at the rate of 1 in 10. The
roadway is to be covered witli a coat of broken metal, broken to a 2J inch gu
ige, and laid i n 7 inches thick at the chan nels and 8 inches at the crown j
and this, when neoeasary, is to ho covered by a coat of loam 1 j inches thick.
Wherever private en trances lead from tho rights of way, they are to he paved
to the width of 10 feet, with blue stone pitchers in the same manner as the
channels | tho paving is to extend from the channels to the line of houses, or
fences, so as to cross the entire footway. Tho foregoing are the general
principles of the works to be performed, but every case will require to he
treated separately as its peculiarities may requiro: JAMES BLACKBURN, 4B4 City

To the Woolgrowers, Merchants, and

Brokers of Victoria., Til HE Woolsorter of Melbourne respectfully

L inform the above parties that they have

formed themselves into a society for the protection of the interests of
employers and employed. We have solely in view our rights and privileges, the
interests of the country we have adopted, and a strict adherence to what we
believe to be our duty to the employers of labor in our branch of business ;
we with to assert our rights as individuals who have thorough knowledge

of our trade, and also to guard the employers of labor, but more especially
the un- wary settlers of this colony against the gross impositions that are
practised upon them by a host of parties who have no pretensions to the trade)
whatsoever, by whom the character of the Wool-sorter of this colony is
necessarily injured,

to say nothing of the injury done to the pecuniary interests of the thorough
tradesman, and not less that of the settler.

In submitting our intentions and regulations to the above parties, we would
wish to be understood that we do not wish to hold any undue influence over the
employers of labor, but we would wish to join them with our warmest endeavours
to elevate and still substantiate Victoria in her character as a wool-growing
colony, and we feel confidently assured that if the wool grower takes tiles
matter into due consideration, we shall arrive at the climax ere long when the
now infant province of Victoria shall be acknowledged as the principal
producer of the great staple article of trade and commerce throughout the
world. The Society, so far as its limited number will admit, will enable
settlers to procure men with a thorough practical knowledge of sorting and
classing at any season of the year. We moreover beg to inform settlers that
each member of this society will be provided with a certificate signed by the
Secretary, which will be a sufficient guarantee against fraud or imposition.
We cordially invite parties in the interior who have a just claim to the trade
to communicate to the Secretary as early as possible, personally would be
preferred, if not, by

letter.

The society's meetings are held on the last Monday of every month at eight
o'clock in the evening.

Surgeon Accoucheur, Licentiate of the Apothecaries' Society of England, Member
of Medical Board of Victoria. ADVICE GRATIS. Morning before Eleven. The
Evenings between Six and half-pnst Eight. PRIVATE CONSULTATION FEE, TEN
SHILLINGS. (Including Medicine). Dr. L. L. SMITH intimates to the public that
for thi3 last nine years he has had the largest practice and one of the most
extensive in this colony. From every part of the colonies he is daily
consulted, not only by those afflicted with the ordinary maladies incidental
commonly to the human frame, and to this colony in particular, but in all
those diseases which have baffled the skill and science of the most eminent
surgeons and physicians of the day ; the well-known name of Dr L. L. Smith,
which has now become as familiar to the ears of the Sydney, Adelaide and
Victorian public, as household words, has natur ally caused those suffering
from these more seri ous diseases to consult him as a derniere resource. Dr L.
L. Smith has thus gained not only a com petency and independent position in
tljis colony, but he has also gained the highest amount oi practical and
theoretical experience in his pro fession. - To those residing in the Bush,
desirous of con sulting and ;eing under his immediate treatment, Dr L. L.
Smith begs leave to state that he has foi their convenience established one of
our largest private institutions in the colony, namely, A LOCK-HOSPITAL, And
Hospital for Skin Diseases. This admirable institution combines within itself
for the pationt all the advantages of a homt, together with the greatest
privacy and certainty oi speedy cure. It has been wcllsupportedand patro nised
by the public for some four years, and that too at a time when, as is well
known by all old colo nists, every other institution of a similar charac* ter
failed.' Indomitable perseverance, steady at tention to his patients, together
with the advan tages of extraordinary experience in his profes sion, and one
of the largest medical libraries in the colony for reference, has been the
sole secret of the success of this institution and its founder. Diseases of
the Eye and Ear, Diseases of Women and Children, SKIN DISEASES, Syphilitic and
Ncivous Affections Particularly attended to. Separate hours exclusively for
Consultations by letter, which latter are immediately answered per sonally by
Dr. L. L. Smith. Hours for Consultation Gratuitously : — Mornings, before
Eleven ; Evenings, Six till Half past Eight o'clock. CONSULTATION FEE, BY
LETTER, £1. DR. L. L. SMITH, 192, 192J, and 194 Bourke street east, Melbourne.

interruption of his arrangements, feels confident the patrons of his
Establishment will fully sympathise with him in the difficulty he has
experienced in the present surmises, which are totally inadequate to receive

the anticipated arrivals of' Goods for the coming

season, it being evident from the very liberal encouragement showered upon his
past efforts, Unit an increase of accommodation and consequent facility of
attention to his numerous customers, is not only absolutely necessary, but
demands

IMMEDIATE ATTENTION.

IT is deeply to be regretted that the Aboriginal

population of Australia is gradually but certainly disappearing from tho face
of the earth. It is gratifying, however, to learn that steps are being taken
to effect their conversion to Christianity, through the means of Missionaries
to be distributed among the various tribes. As little can be effected without
some knowledge of their language, it is trusted that the present publication
may be of service to those engaged in the good cause, as well as being the
means of forming a memento of this interesting people. This being the object
of the compiler, who has no expectation of gain, but not being in a position
to lose by the undertaking, subscription Lists will be left at all the
Booksellers, and as soon as a sufficient number of Subscribers have offered,
the work will be commenced.

HEALTH FOR ALL.

HOLLOWAY'S PILLS AND OINTMENT.

THE pre-eminence of Holloway's Pills for X the cure of a bad Digestion, Liver
and Stomach Complaints The superiority of Hol- loway's Pills as a safe and
effectual remedy in all cases where the stomach is deranged, the digestion
impaired, or the liver diseased, is universally acknowledged by all classes of
society. For the cure of those complaints they surpass every other medicine
hitherto discovered they act so directly upon the disease that sufferers need
only to give them a trial to be convinced of their efficacy, particularly
those persons who have had their maladies aggravated by a long residence in
India ; or,  by sedentary or studious habits.

How to cure by Holloway's Pills, a Disordered state of the Bowels. Thousands
of lives might be saved by adopting the following means: To eschew the use of
fruit, vegetables, pastry, eggs, the fat of meat, sauces, wine, beer, and
spirits, and to avoid committing any excess. To cleanse well the stomach,
liver, and bowels, and purify the blood of all impurities, which will be
effected by taking five or six of Holloway's pills night and morning for
fifteen days, and then for some little time two or three dozen a week. Thus
the highest state of health will be obtained, and even cholera prevented. The
same precau- tion should be taken in cases of ordinary bowel

complaints

A Respectable Member of the Society of Friends cured of Cough and Asthma by
Holloway's Ointment and Pills. Extract of a letter from Mr Benjamin Mncltio to
Professor Holloway, dated Greenough, near Loughgall, September 11, 1848:
""Respected Friends feel it only an act of justice to myself to State that I
have personally experienced the benefit of the excellent Pills and ointment in
the cure of an inveterate Cough and Asthma which afflicted me for three years
to such an extent that I was obliged to walkabout in my room at night, afraid
of suffocation if I went to bed. I then tried thy invalu- able Medicines,
which, I am pleased to say, have perfectly cured me (Signed) Benj. Mackie""

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR TAKING

THE PILLS.

In this place I would impress upon the minds of Invalids this broad and
general principle that HOLLOWAY'S PILLS and OINTMENT are compounded so as to
act harmoniously one with the other, and therefore, when the Ointment is used
us outward application, the Pills are the only internal medicine that should
be used and when the Pills are taken no other Ointment than mine should be
used. I am the more earnest on this point, because I know the value and the
precise mode of operation of my own compositions ; but I cannot be answerable
for the compositions of others, which might either do great injury, or at all
events neutralize the effects of my own. It is indeed, indispensable that this
integrity, with re- spect to my Medicines, should invariably be preserved.

89"" In all cases where it is recommended that Holloway's Ointment be used with
the Pills, cures will be performed in half the time ! indeed, most of such
cases could not be cured without this joint

agency.

These Pills are much used in Warm Climates on account of their depurificatory
qualities. They will, if taken before the immediate approach of disease,
PREVENT ITS INTRUSION, and all its baneful consequences ; while they speedily,
and surely banish disease when the system is already under its influence, and
are, therefore, looked upon as an invaluable SAFEGUARD.

The agreeable coolness and freedom from fever which these pills will induce,
are also great recommendations of their use in sultry and noxious

climates.

Experience will teach the most timid that the doses recommended, so far from
being too large, are in many cases not sufficiently copious, and many strong
persons in obstinate disorders will derive immediate benefit by taking still
greater doses, in order that the superfluous fluids may be quickly carried off
in the form of foul and slimy evacuations. To accomplish this it is essential
that the bowels be moved by light and easy mo- tions frequently in the course
of twenty-four hours, which cannot harm the most delicate frame, but v>M do
great good to all by laying the foundation of health and strength.

All heavy and drowsy sensations, which are the forerunners of direful
diseases, as Apoplexy, Paralytic Strokes, free we, are effectually warded off
by a few doses of this searching medicine  it also immediately produces sound
and refresh- ing sleep, with a high flow of spirits, together with great
vigour and lightness of body, as well as a keen appetite to enjoy the most
homely fare. Sight and hearing (so indispensable to our- enjoyment and
happiness) are strengthened by the decoration of their respective organs ; so
that it may in truth be said Here is Health for

All!!!""

Specification of Works necessary to be done in

forming the various rights of way in the City of Melbourne.

10th February, 1851.

The natural soil is to be reduced or made up, as the case may require so that
the longitudinal

section of the whole right of way shall in no _ part have an inclination of
less than 1 in 120 and  wherever practicable, the entire length is to form one
incline. In laying on any sturt' it is to be spread in layers of not not more
than 1 foot thick The transverse section of the right of way is to show a
roadway whose crown shall be inch above the kerbs of the footways, and the

fall from the crown to the water channels is to be at the rate of 1 in 25.

On either side of the roadway there is to be a water channel 18 inches wide,
consisting of two rows of bluestone pitchers 9 inches deep, and not less than
9 inches by 14 inches on the surface, with upright sides, set in loam, and
rammed with a hammer weighing 40 lbs so as to

subside 4 inches. The bottom of the channel is

to be 7 inches below the top of the kerbs.

On either side of the roadway there is also to be a footway not less than 3
feet wide, and these are to be separated from the roadway by a red gum plank
or kerb 10 x 3, set on edge, and fastened with 5 inch spikes to piles 4's 4 of
red gum, S feet long, driven into the soil. The footways are to be covered
with a coat of gravel 3 inches thick, and the surface is to fall towards the
channel at the rate of 1 in 10. The road- way is to be covered with a coat of
broken metal, broken to a 24 inch gauge, and laid on 7 inches thick at the
channels and 8 inches at the crown and this, when necessary, is to be covered
by a coat of loam 11 inches thick. Wherever private entrances lend from the
rights of way, they are to be paved to the width of 10 feet, with blue stone
pitchers in the same manner as the channels e, the paving is to extend from
the channels to the line of houses, or fences, so as to cross the entire
footway.

The foregoing are the general principles of the works to be performed, but
every case will require to be treated separately as its peculiarities party
require.
