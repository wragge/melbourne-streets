spoke in a loud tone. Witness had not spoken to licr for Several months. In
tho evening defendant feme out again and repeated 1'or remarks. Witness told
Mr. Fiecmau that she had given Mrs. Stein no provocation. The yard ^bero the
language was used ""was not. far from lbs street. She bad not told Mrs. Stein
'to ""take her dirty kids inside and wash Ibem.'' Defendant had no reason
whatever for calling her names. WitneES taid slie had domestic duties to
attend to and bad no lime for gossiping. The noise bad caused a crowd to
collect, but it liad been a onesided argument, because iviv fcess had not
spoken a word to Mrs. Stem. Joseph Mullen said lie was a. boaider Ml*. Hem. Ho

language was beard by persons in the streets. Mary Stein stated that Mia.
Beers lind continually been ""chucking oil"" about her children. Defendant said
fho had been forced to retaliate, but the worst she lind said was to call
complainant ""a dirly old hay-bag."" Replying to Sergeant O'Donnell, defendant
said she bad not complained to Mrs lkers tbat she bad Gent the city inspector

VARIOUS MATTERS.

Mails by th"" R..M..S. Orizaba, which left Melbourne on thCli uIL. arrived iu
London last Sunday evening. The report of the proceedings at the In-

i uTcotcmai (.onti-rence or Manufacturers j in Melbourne this morning, will be
found : on Page 2. This afternoon Mr A. Gibs an. i M.L.C., of Queensland, went
to consider able trouble ti show that large numbers . of white people gc-t
employment or de- J pt-nded upen the sugar industry of North Queensland.
pointed out that, al- , though there wa an idea that the colony i was jJjoJt-J
by the blacks, th'. re were uniy j S-lw Kanakas in a population of over half ;
a million, ii? said that a special duty cf L3 per ton in favor of Queensland
sugar i would be accepted by that colony. Detective S. WILtn, late of the
Railway ! departine-t. ha for the last ton days been j confined to h.s
residence. Kensington. i suffering fr-;r; a severe attack of bron- j chilis
ar.d Influenza, j Jrhn Wood, 40 years rf age, who lives ! at No. 5?5 Little
Lonsdale street, sud- j dcnly fell down in th? street to-uay. He ; cut hfs
head badiy on the flagging of th? I foblpmh when li? fell. He was picked i up
and taken to the Melbourne Hc»3plta! 5 by a constable, where Dr Spring ue- '
tained him for observation, j The extra attention given by th? de- | tccUves
to the undesirable class of pe-opl? j who frequent Flemlngton ' racacour.se 1
during the spring. racing carnival, has J been productive of very satisfactory
re- ' suit. Inspector Sharp states that only one case of larceny from the
person was reported as having been committed at Flemlngton yesterday, and this
took place on the Hill. The Defence Department infers, from the absence cf
adverse criticism by any of the war correspondents who accompa nied the Medic,
that there was little to fir.d fault with in the transport arrange ments. It
is assumed that by the time Albany was reached any serious defects would have
made themselves manifest. No complains having been made, the d«- i partment is
exceedingly pleased, esptcial- . Is as arrangements had to be made by it j for
the contingents cf four colonies. The steamer Aberdeen, with the New South
Wales contingent on board, was timed to leave Port Melbourne sharp a: four
o'clock this afternoon. A number of officers and men of the Permanent Ar
tillery and Field Artillery Brigade went down to bid farewell to Colonel
Umphelby nnd Captain Johnston, who are leaving for special service in South
Africa. Captain Bruohe was also farewelled by a number of hi brother officers,
and the bind of the Permanent Artillery played on the pier. The Melbourne wool
sales were con tinued this afternoon at the Wool Ex change. when large-
catalogues were of fered by Messrs Younghusband and Co. Limited and
Goldsbrough. Mort and Co. Limited. There was a good (attendance and prices
were well maintained. An order of the North Melbourne mag istrate?, requiring
Hugh Esler. junior.- to pay Mabel Bye Ss a week for the mainten ance of a
child, was quashed by Judge Hamilton, in the Court of General S-«- slons this
afternoan. The District Coroner, Mr Morrison, held an enquiry to-day. Into the
circumstance? attending the death of James Martin Claridge, who was found
lying insensible la Little Kent street, Richmond, early yesterday morning.
Thomas Smith, boot maker. residing In Buckingham street. Richmond, gave
evidence as to finding 'he deceased lying :cros3 uhe gut.er la a dying
condition. David Clarldgc. brother of deceased, said that ho never heard de
ceased complain of being unwell. He had always appeared to witness to be In
the best of health and spirits. The medical evidence showed that deceased
suffered from cancer in the tongue, which bad af fected the Internal organs,
and produced a complication of diseases.- The Imme diate cause of death wo?
blood-poisoning. A deputation from the Ballarat Agri cultural Society urged
the Minister of Agriculture this afternoon to grant the National Show to that
society next year (1900). It was asserted that the National Show had not been
held in Bafinrat for nine years, and the Improvements made at the show grounds
were diluted upon. Mr G. G. Morton was the principal speaker, and was
supported by the Mayor of Ballarat (Cr. Heinz) and the President of the local
Chamber of Commerce (Mr Xlven). .Mr Taverner said he could not give a finul
answer to-day. There wero several application?. Baliarat's elalms would have
full consideration. Messrs Vale, M'Gregor, Spiers, and Russell. M.'sL.A., and
Williamson. M.L.C., ac companied the deputation. The sports meeting which was
to have been hold to-morrow in connection with the Coburg Carnival, has been
