At the City Court, on Wednesday, Joseph Jackson and Mary A. Bryant again
appeared to answer a charge of having violently assaulted Charles West, who
described himself as a joiner residing in Flinders street west. The prosecutor
stated that, on the 10th of this month, he went to see Mrs Bryant, at the
house occupied by Jackson, in Latrobe street. She was doing some needlework
for him. He went

mere Detween nine ana len a.m. on me uay in question. While sitting in the
room Jackson and another man came in. They were friendly enough at first, and
they all played at cards for pints of rum. They played whist at first, witness
and Mrs Bryant being partners. Afterwards played all fours with Jackson, who
lost. Witness fetched the rum. Re mained there until the afternoon. When he
was sitting on the sofa, the prisoner sitting at the table opposite, Mrs
Bryant got up and left the room, and just after Jackson threw a bottle at him,
which struck him on the top of the head. The blow rendered him senseless at
the time. Nothing was said before that. When he came to himself he could not
see, but he heard the voice of a woman, who was trying to stop the blood.
Jackson was in the room at the time, and appeared to be very excited. He said,
'I will be hung for that man.' The female said, ' You have done enough.' The
doctor was then sent for, and he was taken to the hospital. The cut on the eye
was not received at the same time as the blow on the head. He had also marks
on the breast which were not there before. The only reason the prosecutor
could assign for the assault was that prisoner thought he had too much
influence with Mrs Bryant. On cross-examination by Mr Turner, West denied
having been very drunk at the time, but admitted that he had got on the table
for merriment. He was sober enough to know what he was doing, and did not fall
on to a bottle or glass. The prisoner took him to the hospital. While giving
his evi dence, the prosecutor was accommodated with a chair, being in a very
weak state from the effects of the wounds he had received. Mary A. Bryant, who
was at first charged with being concerned in the assault, was admitted as a
witness, the charge against her being withdrawn. She stated that she was a
married woman; but did not know where her husband was. She lived in a room
hired of the prisoner, at 2 Little Lonsdale street. She left the prosecutor
and prisoner together in the room ; when in tho yard she heard the breaking of
glass. She went into the house, not thinking that anything had happened there.
She found the prosecutor lying on the floor, with his head covered with blood.
The prisoner was kicking him. She pushed Jackson away, and said, ' What have
you been doing.' Both were sober at the time. Prosecutor looked vacantly at
tho witness, who asked him to speak to her, which ho presently did. Prisoner
then rushed forward, saying, ' He's not dead, but I'll kill him, and bo hung
for him.' He was coming with his fist, when witness warded off tho blow,
holding the prosecutor in her arms. Prisoner struck her between the shoulders,
and afterwards on the chest. Whon sho left the room there was a soda wator
bottle and an old torn bottle. When she ro turned tholattor was broken, and
tho pieces were on the sofa, whoro prosecutor had been lying. The

bottom of the sodawater bottle was also lying on the table. The fragments,
with some articles of cloth ing, were produced in court. Felix Henry Kempster,
hospital surgeon, deposed to the prosecutor having been brought to the
hospital by the prisoner, who said he had fallen from a car. Prosecutor was
much intoxicated, and prisoner slightly so. There were two wounds, one of
which was dressed. Neither of_ the wounds were dangerous. He remained in the
hospital ten days, suffering from erysipelas. He might have fallen from the
sofa or table and cut himself with the bottles. Mark Dolan, No. 89, deposed to
the arrest of the prisoner, who stated that he had struck the prosecutor with
his fist. Mrs Bryant was . sweeping up the room. Witness produced pieces of
glass and clothes stained with blood. Caroline Holmes, who assisted Mrs Bryant
to wash West's head, stated what she saw and did. Prisoner was committed for
trial, but admitted to bail in £50. 'Viotobia Sprawling in her own Mire.' *
The announcement that a lecture of a novel description would be delivered, on
Monday, in the Trades' Hall, Lygon street, by Mr Parsons, barris ter- at-law,
drew together, at the appointed hour, rather more than a hundred persons. The
lecturer promised to treat upon the following sub jects, admission being free
: — ' The Anti- Transporta- tion Agitation— Its Advocates.' ' The Argus.' '
The Government and Mr Cohen.' ' The Provi dent Institute— Its Treatment.'
'Immigration to Lower Wages.' Trading Philanthropy.' ' The Torrens Act.' ' The
Land Acts.' ' Our Legis lators.' ' Our Lawyers.' ' Victoria Sprawling in Her
Own ?Mire— Her Way Out.' The lecturer began by alluding to the anti-
transportation agita tion, but, as he appeared to be in favor of the infusion
of the convict element into Western Aus tralia, at least, his views were but
coldly received. He then went on to refer to the Provident Insti tute,
remarking widely upon the colonial aspect of commerc,ial and social morality
in connection with the rise and fall of this institution. He next spoke of the
real property laws and of the lawyers. He said before he had been six months
in this colony he was making £2000 a year, but he became too fastidious to con
nive at the rascality which he found was necessary to support a practice here,
having been taught never to tell a lie, so he gave up his practice. He did not
attribute this state of things to the solicitors, because there would be no
servitors of iniquity if iniquity did not exist; and, though he was hittinc
the lawyers hard, he thought he was hitting then clients harder. His knowledge
of the real property law was extensive, but it was oi no use to him here,
because he could not do the ne farious business required by the people. He
admitted he was drawing a dark picture of mankind, but before they could
become a good, virtuous and happy people (the very terms of which qualities,
he doubted not, were offensive to the meeting), it was necessary that they
should be made aware of those things. It would eventu ally be the mission of
some person to point out and remedy these evils, but he did not think it
possible he could himself furnish either the hand or the head for this
purpose. But, as it was, the iniqui ties at present existing must continue to
flourish, however much he might desire to remedy them. He said, in conclusion,
he expected to have found in the Trades' Hall ? an audience who would have
received him with greater warmth. He was prepared to admit that he had not
been very prudent in blending so many subjects to gether in a lecture. He
expected, however, to have been able to run through them all, but finding that
the very word ' convict' was so revolting to the meeting that he could not
bespeak any consideration for that class, he was not inclined to continue
further. He had taken care that his defeat should affect no one but himself,
and with that view he had not permitted any chairman to be appointed, or
allowed any of his friends or family to accompany him into the room. He was
extremely sorry for having put the meeting to any trouble, but he should not
continue the lecture any longer. It may be necessary to mention that the last
half of the speaker's remarks were received with the most uproarious mirth,
which was chiefly pro voked by the extraordinary quaintness of style and
grotesque grouping of the sentences, which charac terised all that was said ;
and Mr Parsons himself frequently joined in the general laughter. The lecturer
was repeatedly urged to continue his re marks upon the subjects he had
promised to speak upon, but he steadfastly refused, saying he had evi dently
made a mistake, and come to the wrong place ; but, at the same time, he
entertained none but the kindest feelings towards the meeting. A vote of
thanks was then proposed, but the lecturer declined to accept it. The
gentleman moving in this matter suggested that at least they had all been very
much amused, which called forth from Mr Parsons the remark that he had not
come there to amuse them. Though he persisted that a vote of thanks could not
be passed to a man who refused to accept it, the motion was put and carried by
acclamation. The proceedings then terminated, the lecturer having first
distributed a parcel of pamphlets entitled ' An offer to frame and initiate
the administration of a Real Property Law.' ' Gallant Conduct of a Shipmaster.
— On Wed nesday Captain Peter Wilkie, commander of the clipper ship Aboukir,
was presented in Glasgow with a purse of 150 sovereigns and an address en
graved on vellum in recognition of his gallant and seamanlike conduct in
bringing homo his vessel while in a crippled, condition from New Zealand to
London. The presentation was made on behalf of the underwriters of the ship
and cargo in London and Glasgow. On the 1st of April last, the Aboukir, one of
Messrs Potter, Wilson and Co.'s liners, sailed from Otago for London, under
the command of Captain Wilkie. After being nine days at sea, the ship, while
inlat. 55° 40' S., long. 153° W., was overtaken by thick weather, in
consequence of which sho got foul on an iceberg, and was dis masted. At noon
of the same day (9th of April) the fog cleared off, when the vessel was found
to bo com pletely surrounded by ice. In consequence of tho loss of her maiits
she became unmanageable, but under tlie directions of Captain Wilkie jurymasts
were rigged, by means of which the ship was extri catod from her helpless and
perilous condition, and enabled to continuo her voyage. When near Cape Horn a
very heavy gale was encountered ; but the ship behaved splendidly under her
juvymasts, and the storm was weuthered without mishap. On tho 1st of Maj7 tho

The court for the, revision of the supple- mentary rollB for jîast and West
Melbourne resumed its sittings yesterday, and proceeded with the objections
lodged by Mr. Josoph Jones against names in St James's division. The
magistrates on the bench were-The Mayor (in the chair), and MesBrs. W. Bowen,
J. Finlay, Gunn, W. E. King, J. Hughes, R. Kerr, C. M. Officer, C. Ryan, C. W.
Hughes, A. Short, II. A. Clarke, H. C. Fraser, W. Bajles, J. Laurens, M.L.A.
In each case Mr. M'Farland and Mr. Gregory appeared on behalf of the objector,
Mr. Jones.

The case of Edward Dixon, labourer, re- siding on Batman's-svvamp, which was
post- poned from the previous day in order to allow further inquiries to be
instituted m lefcrence to the person, was taken.

Edward Dixon, having been called by Mr. M'Kean.deposedthathc resided in the
vicinity of Brown's fellmongery, near the Melbourne Gaavvorks, and had been
horn on the swamp. His father had lived there for the last 25 jears. .

Mr. M'KEAN stated that the objection against Dixon's namo was frivolous, inas-
much as if Mr. Jones had instituted proper

inquiries, Dixon could have been found. Mr. M'Kean considered that no
reasonable in- quiry bud been mode for the person, and ap- plied for coBts, aa
Dixon had attended at the Court for four days, .

Mr. M'FAR-AND objected to Mr. M'Kean applying for costs in almost every case
where the objections against the names were with- drawn. The address of Dixon
was given in the list as Batman's Swamp, which was very vague. '

Mr. Joseph Green stated that he had made inquiries in reference to the man
Dixon, but could not find him, the name not being known by other persons
residing at Batman _ Swamp. |

Mr, M'FAH_AND.-The Bench have appa- rently made up their minds to grant costs
without giving me an opportunity of replying to Mr. M'Keatl. , ,' |

Mr. LAUBENS considered that the address given in the list was very indefinite.

The name was allowed, with £1 Is. costa. I

The names of James Grundy, labourer, 158 Bomke-street, Patrick Haughey,
labourer, off Littlo Bourke-strect, and Thomas Hillard, labourer, Bourke-
street, were struck off the supplementary lista, on the ground of non

residence.

Mr. Joseph Jones stated that the objection against Hodson, name had been
withdrawn.

Mr.|M'K_AN considered that Hodson should be awarded costa.

Mr. M'FABLAND objected to the application for costs. i

The name was allowed without costs.

The objections against J. Hybinet, of C9 William-street, storeman ; Edward
Inman, clerk, Batman's Swamp ; Michael Kelly, carter, 142 Latrobe-street ; on
the ground of non-residence were withdrawn.

Mr. M'KEAN, on behalf of Michael Keyrana, labourer, off Little Bourke-street,
whose name was objected to on the ground of non-resi-, dence, applied for
costa, the objection having been withdrawn. He contended that suffi-

cient inquiry for the address of Keyrana had not been made. Name allowed, with
£2 2a.

The name of William M'Kenna, labourer, Little Bourke-street,' was objected to
on the ground of non-residence, but the Bench de- cided to allow the name.

Mr. M'KEAN.applied for costs in the case.

Mr. M'FABLAND.-This ia another struggle

for 10s. 6d.'

Mr. M'KEAN protested against such insinua- tions from Mr. 'M'Farland, and
desired the Bench to protect him from Buch insults.

The MAYOB stated that Mr. M'Kean waa entitled to apply for costs, but in the
case of Mr. M'Kenna no coBts could be awarded, as sufficient evidence had not
been shown that the objection waa frivolous. -, '

Tlie lists for St. Mary's division in the West Melbourne electorate were then
taken.

The name of Patrick Bourke, labourer, of Latrobe-street, was objected to on
the ground that the name was où tho general roll.

Mr. M'KEAN opposed the application to atriko the 'name off the supplementary
roll, jnpsirmch as the registrar, Mr. Fraser, had failed to forward the
electoral lists to the clerk of petty sessions when the lists were published,
aa required by the 42nd section of the Electoral Act. ,

Mr. Campbell, the clerk of petty sessions, having been duly sworn, deposed
that he received the lists for St. Mary'a divi- sion on the 18th July, and
those for St. Patrick's division on the 7th AuguBt.

I Mr. M'FABLAND submitted that the mere fact of the registrar having failed to
carry out his instructions, did not interfere with the jurisdiction of the
Court, and nothing had been brought forward to show that the jurisdiction of
the Court was made contingent on the forwarding of tho lista to the clerk of
petty sessions at the time they were pub Imbed,

The Bench overruled the point raised by Mr. M'Kean, and decided to proceed
with the consideration of the objections. The names were then taken seriatim,
and more than tvvo-thirdB of the number on tho list were ordered to be struck

Donnelly was charged with this offence. James Betts stated that to was a
teamster, and had been up tho country. AA'as in Melbourne on the 18tli
November, and was taken to tho Foundry Hotel by another man named Cavanagli,
and after they had been in tho room somo short time, the prisoner came in and
proposed a game with some chalk. AVitness consented to play, and lost £6.
Prisoner picked up the money, and then invited wit ness and tho other man to
liavo a drink. AAritnoss described tho game, which consisted simply of toss
ing up a halfpenny anil chalking down tho result. It appeared to be an act of
sheer folly on the part of tho prosecutor. Prisoner was discharged. — Thomas
Cavanagli was charged with obtaining £8 by the samo means from the same party.
In this case it seems ho lost £8, and recovered £6 2s 6d. Prisoner was
discharged. Atioi.ent Assault. — Joseph Jackson and Mary A. Bryant again
appeared to answer a charge of having violently assaulted Charles ? AArcst,_
who described liimseif as a joiner residing in Flinders strcot west. The
prosecutor stated that, on tho 10th of this month, lie went to see Mrs Bryant,
at the house occupied by Jackson, in Latrobe street. She was doing somo
needlework for him. Ho went there between nine nnd ten a.m.- on tho day in
question. AVhilo sitting in tho room Jackson and nnoihor man came in. They
were friendly enough at first, aud thoy all played at cards for pints of ruin.
Thoy played whist at first, witness und Mrs Bryant being partners. Afterwards
played oil fours with Jiiekson, who lost. AAltncss fetched the ruin. Re mained
there until tho afternoon. _ When he wns sitting on tho sofa, the prisoner
sitting nt tho table opposite, Mrs Bryant got up and left the room, and just
uftcr Jackson threw a bottlo at him, which struck him on the top of the head.
The blow rendered him senseless at tho time. Notliiug was said beforo that.
AA'lien he came to himself ho could not seo, but ho heard Uio voice of a
woman, who was trying to stop Uio blood. Jackson was in the room nt tho timo,
nnd nppenred lo bo very excited. Ho said, 'I wilt ho hung for that mail.' The
female said, ' You have dono enough.' Tho doctor was then sent for, and ho was
taken to the hospital. Tho cut on the eye was not received at the same timo as
the blow on tho head. He had also marks on the breast which wero not thore
before. The only reason the prosecutor could assign for the assault wns that
prisoner thought he had. too much influence with Mrs Bryaut, On cross-
examination by Mr Turner, AVcst denied having been very drnnk at the time, but
admitted that ho had got on tho table for merriment. He was sober enough to
know what ho was doing, and did not fall on to a bottle or glass. Tho prisoner
look him to the hospital. AVliile giving his evi dence, the prosecutor was
accommodated with a chair, being -in a very weak state from Uio eileets nf tlm
wnnnds he had received. MarvA. Brvant, who

was at first charged with boing concerned in the assault; was admitted as a
witness, the charge against her being withdrawn. She stated that she was a
married woman ; but did not know where her husband was. She lived in a room
hired of the prisoner, at 2 Little Lonsdale street. She left tho prosecutor
nnd prisoner together in the room ; when in the yard she heard the breaking of
glass. She wont iuto Uio house, not thinking that anything had happened there.
' She found the prosecutor lying on tho floor, with his head covered with
blood, i'ho prisoner was kicking him. She pushed Jnckson oway, and said, '
What have you been doing.'' Both wore sober nt tho time. Prosecutor looked
vacantly at the witness, who asked him to speak to hor, which lie presently
did. Prisoner then rushed forward, saying, ' He's not dead, but I'll kill
liim, and be hung for him.' Ho wns coining with his fist, when witness warded
off tho Blow, holding the prosecutor in lier armB. Prisoner struck her between
the shoulders, and afterwards on the chest. When she left the room there was a
soda water bottle and an old torn bottle. AVlien she re turned Uie latter was
broken, aud Uie pieces were on

the sofa, where prosecutor had been lying. Tho bottom of the sodnwater bottle
was also lying on tbe table. Tho fragments, with some articles of cloth ing,
were produced in court. Felix Henry Kcmpster, hospital surgeon, deposed to the
prosecutor having been brought to the hospital by the prisoner, who snid lie
had fallen from n car. Prosecutor wns much intoxicated, and prisoner slightly
so. There were two wounds, one of which was drcssed Neithcr of the wounds wero
dangerous. Ho remained in the hospital ten days, suffering from erysipelns. He
might have fallen from the sofa or tjiblo nnd cut himself with thebnltles.
Mark Dolan, No. 89, deposed to the arrest of tho prisoner,, who stated that ho
had struck tho prosecutor with his fist. Mrs Bryant was sweeping up the room.
AA'itness produced pieces of glass nnd clothes stained with 'blood. Caroline
Holmes, who nssistod Mrs Bryaut to wash AA'est's head, stated what she saw nnd
did. Prisoner was committed for trial, but admitted to bail in £50. The court
then adjourned until half -past one o'clock. In the meantime the list of
applicants for nuctioneers' licenses was read off and tho applica tions
granted. The court resumed shortly before two o'clock. The Sydney Forgers. —

to the Royal Artillery Hotel, and Mr Story, the landlord, and his daughter
stated that the men had been slinvon nfter their arrival. Mr Story nnd tho
limber could be produced. The bench did not consider the evidence sufficient ;

worshipping in the PROTESTANT HALL; Stephen Street, Melbourne, Under tho
ministry of Mio Rev. M. Mnokay, L.L.D., i Into of the Free Church, Dunoon,
Scotland, Melbourne, April 27, 1861, Dear Brethren, Wo havo boon ©looted b.r
yourselves, or with your consent, a Committee to manage the temporal affairs
of our Congregation. Wo noeept the trust in brotherly love, and with gratitude
to you for your confidence in us ; and wo appeal to voursidves whether wo have
not undertaken duties of a very anxious kind. And our appeal is also now *o
your selves, that you strengthen our bands and bo mutu ally helpful to
yourselves and to us, in prosecuting the groat and Important undertakings
before us. W© bnyo all but one interest, and we trust one great object in
view. The special work to bo undertaken by ns at pre sent is the erection of a
suitable ami respectable place of worship, and a Minister’s dwelling-house.
Without both of these being provided, we all know that the cause which we all
profess to love,—the building up of the Church of our Fathers, in con nexion
with our own native language, in this city, cannot, humanly speaking, bo
placed externally on a solid basis. Every consideration demands that those
undertakings ho immediately prosecuted, and with determination and vigor. The
spiritual in forests oven of all our fellow countrymen throughout tins
extensive and wonderful Colony, as well as your o-vn, arc instnnnentally
dependant now upon the liberality, 'he vigor, and tho united and unanimous
faithfulness with which this work shall ho prosecuted by vou and by us.
Resident as we ore. In or around the capital city of Victoria, God's
providence has placed us in tho very front of the advancing work which is to
be carried forward, if wc tnilv dosiro to sec (bo glorious Gospel of the Graco
of God have free course given ii among our countrymen in this distant land.
Exam ple will bo fatten from tis. Shall wo, then, desert the post to which wo
am called? Nay. dear Brethren, let us rather eateem it our privilege and our
honour. And if ibis point be maintained by us, under tho good hand of God. it
must bo by very vigorous, very liberal, and faithful efforts on our part and
vours.'eacb one. Nor do we think there arc any in-uperable difficulties in our
wav ; if only wo bo faithful to Dim who calls us to Ilia own work. It is
computed that the. undertakings named, wil cost not a loss sum than Twelve
thousand pounds sterling. The number of hearers already attending the ser
vices in our temporary place of worship (English and Gaelic), is estimated at
Six Hundred. Dividing the amount stated among all those equally, it would just
amount to Twenty pounds sterling to each Individual. But, wc all know that a
large majority of onr follow-worshippers and countrymen nro but recently
arrived in the Cojony; that these havo not'yet accumulated money; and that
there tiro many among them who havo not yet attained even to the ordinary
comforts of life. Their contributions, therefore, can be hut very limited. Wo
think, at tile same time, that no one among them ought to excuse or exempt
themselves from bestowing ac cording to their means; and we would earnestly
impress upon them the great value of accumulated nttlcs, in suoh an
undertaking ns this is. And, as theio are many others,—native TTighlan. ders
amongst us, whom the providence of God has highly favored in their temporal
lot,—wo do cherish the li pn, that none of you dear brethren will grudge to
bestow largely and liberally upon our important undertaking. It is by tho
ablest amons-st us, that the largest bestowals, even proportionably, will fall
l P 0n y° u ' 8,10,1 of you as are placed by God s kind providence, in
affluence and prosperity, and whose temporal circumstances will not be
affected, far less injured, even by a very munificent bestowal, for once on
such a cause as this;—on vou permit us in brotherly love and faithfulness
to'say! i« devolved the duty, and the privilege too, of setting example to
others, and of your being specially help ful to our cause, in this the time of
its special coed. And will you not permit us to look to you with con fidence
at tb/s most important time, that you shall emu.ato and follow the noble
examples set in cur native land, on recent times, by generous, large hearted
bestowals upon t he Lord’s work, in the time of His Church’s need. W e
rejoice, and are p 'rhaS! fc° W ’ *? ni - ll,atH,el ' B . that Highlanders at
home have been the icremostin this nofclo work. .. rlle practical value of
such bestowals is in kheir cheerful readiness and promptitude. Even a few such
examples amongst us at present would go wftl? ° f ( i o<i ?? on t i! WW ’
tonljimate us with the mind and spirit which our work de mands. ‘ The lord
