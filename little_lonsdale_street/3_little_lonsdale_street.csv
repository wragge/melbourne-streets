EESTOT OF THE REFERENDUM.

A Tardy Announcomont.

Prlmo Minister Hughes, speaking at Bondigo on Tuesday, announced what ho
declared to bo tho results of tho soldiers' voto at tho recent referendum on
conscription. It is significant that this announcement was deferred until tho
arrival in tho Commonwealth of two British papers containing tho re
sults—which results; l»y tho way, difTor materially from thoso announced by
Mr. Hughes. Tho pretext for delaying tho announcement, was that the British
military authorities requested tho Com* monweulth Government to keep tho re

sults of tho soldiers' voto secret. Mr. Walter Long (.Secretary of Stato for
the Colonics) declared, however, in answer to a question in the House of
Commons, thnt the matter was entirely

at the discretion of the Commonwealth Government. It is evident that tho
Imperial Government lias made no at tempt to suppress the results, as tho
figures have been published in two British journals 'which have now reach ed
Australia.

According to Mr. Ilughes, tho sol diers' voto resulted us follows:—

For Conscription 72,000 Against 58,000

Majority 14,000

1 No details wero given of -what votes

j-wero included or excluded. The total I votes accounted for in Mr. Hughes'* I
announcement number only J.'50,000,

: whereas at least 100.000 more possible I

votes are unaccounted for. It ia pos- |

sible, of course, that owing to military ; exigencies a uurnber of soldiers
might !

not have been able to exorcise the I franchise, and many more may not have
troubled to vote; but surely the discrepancy should not have been so much as
100,000 votes. However, per haps in tirno we shall have more light on this
aspect of tho subject.

| If it. bo true, as Mr. Hughes asserts, | that tho soldiers gave ''a
substantial j majority"" for conscription, then ho j made a"" serious error in
tactics in not

announcing tho results before the Ile ! ferendum was taken in the Common j
wealth. Wo understand that the re

! suits of the soldiers' voto v.-ere known I in Melbourne a day or two before
Oc i tober 2S, and it appears clear from Mr. ! Hughes's manifesto to tho
troops that

he intended to announce the results before the Referendum was taken in
Australia, in order, as he informed the soldiers, that they might ""give a
lead""

| to civilian voters. Why, then, -were tho jknotvn results not announced as
was j intended if the soldiers gave an aftirma

Itivo vote? The natural conclusion is

j fairly obvious; but if Mr. Hughes has i any other explanation we should like
to

! hear it.

The figures published in tho two British journals are, as we have said,
totally different from those given by Mr. Hughe*. The ""Glasgow Weekly Herald""
of January 13 gives tho re sults of the soldiers' vote as follows:—

""No"" 20fi,COC ""Yes"" 40,000

""Xo"" Majority .. CG,000

Tho Dublin ""Freeman's Journal"" gives tho same figures. Mr. Hughes, in his
usual elegant style, denounces these as false; but if that bo so it is cer
tainly stiange that the two papers should tell the same tale. Tho only way to
set the matter at rest is to allow the Chief Electoral Ofiicer to publish u
return showing the total number of votes cast by the men on active ser j vice,
and enumerating the classes of (voters included in the return—soldiers, '
sailors, nurses, etc. No one wants to know the details—a grand total of votes
for and against will do—so long

as we know that all the active servico I voters are included, and that tho an-
I nouncetnent is made by a man iu whom tho general public have confidence. j

THE MEDLATORSHIP OF JESUS  CHRIST.,Article,1925-11-05,20,20,Members of the Catholic Evidence Guild will agree with me that there is no text of Scripture f[?]ung at the speaker more frequently than that,https://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/171410477?searchTerm=text%3A%223+little+lonsdale+street%22%7E0,792,"Advocate (Melbourne, Vic. : 1868 - 1954)",3.4603992,very relevant,,"Hie Interpretation of a Text.

THE MEOIATOB8HIP OF -JESUS r CHRIST.

(By the Rev. 3. 33. toward, in the Liverpool ""Catholic Times."")

Members of the Catholic Evidence •Guild will agree with me that there is no
text of Scripture flung at the speaker more frequently than that which occurs
in St. PauVs first letter to St. Timothy. • It is thfe fifth verse of the
second chapter, and reads thus: 'Tor there is one God: and one mediator of God
and man, the man Christ Jesus."" Here, the heckler insists, we have St. Paul
proclaiming -the xnique me-, diatorship of Christ. If Christ is the one
mediator, then why go to confession to airiest? Is not tnat putting a man
between the soul and •Christ? And why beg the.intercessions of the saints,
since that again is interfering -' with the position ot Christ as the one
mediator? . , ^APgerxtt lext-Slinghig. The -iisse,"" or, rather., abuse, of
this text is an interesting example <of the • danger of^mere text-slinging, in
which Protestants have been so prone to indulge. First of all,, they quote
part of a text, and not the whole of it. St. x aul certainly says ""that Christ
is the one J Mediator, but he clearly defines in what sense He has that
position, Let us read the whole text. St. Paul writes: ""For there is one God:
and one mediator of God and man, the man Christ Jesus, Who gave Himself a
redemption -for all."" Here we have the clue to St, Paul's meaning. Christ is
the one Mediator in the sense that He alone redeemed us. He is the one
Mediator of redemption. To that statement Catholics wholeheartedly subscribe.
We believe and affirm that Christ and Christ alone redeemed us, that by His
Blood alone we are saved. Then, again, the text is divorced from the context.
If we read the. verses before and after we find that St. Paul, so far from
excluding other mediators, actually implies and states that there are ether
intermediaries between the -Soul and <3od in the economy of- salvation. In the
first verse ef that very chapter we read: ""I desire, therefore, first o^ all,
that supplications,- prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings be made for all
men."" Thea in verge seven St..Paul writes: ""Whereunto I am appointed a
preacher and an apostle <1 say the truth, I lie not), a doctor Of the
Gentiles' in--faith-and truth."" The context . therefore snakes clear - that,
whilst Chrjpt is the unique Med^tor of redemption,.there are nevertheless
dependent and subordinate -mediatorships of-intercession :?and of teaching.,
It is obvious that such lessjer oiediatora .are not ..conflict with. Christ's
office, otherwise St> -Paul would be , contradicting,,himself. . A .moment's
reflection will convince us of the fact that the. andnte toy -of-.intercession
and .teaching'-tends-to magnify-the g>ower of Christ. and. nst .to minimise
it, for the power of the intercessor arid the authority' lot t<»eher both come
from Ghrist. „..,..• God's^U#e of totormediaries. Not only is this -text
divorced Iroin the context, but it is in.conflict with , the whole message of
.the Bible as a whole. God in His dealings with men has chosen to act
constantly by means of ministers .and intermedial--

hundreds in that eelony. About 18 months ago VITA- DATIO vii introduced Into
New Zealand, and is new a household wotd from Intercargill to Aaskland, and
hundreds have been Cnred of their Complaints and Diseases who had been
pronounced Incurable. VITA- DATIO is new being placed upon the Market of
Victoria, and all the Agents ask is that ea&erars; may give it a fair trial.
The Proprietor, Mr. W. WEBBER, of Launceston, after an etperienoe of 10 years,
has in his possession Incontestable proof that VITADATIO will Cure BRIGHT'S
DISEASE, CANCER, KIDNEY and LIVER TROUBLES, GftAVEL, HYDATIDS, PILES, SKIN
DISEASES in all their forms and stages (except hereditary); in faet, VITADATIO
will cure ALL DISEASES Which arise from an IMPURE STATE OF THE BLOOD.
Sufferers should not fail to give it a trial Sold in Bottles, Price 3s 6d and
6s 6d. BILIARY CALCULI (Gail Stones). Suffered more or less from 1888 to 1897.
MRS. BURK SPEAKS VERY PLAINLY. To Mr. S. A. Palmer, Sole Wholesale Agent for
VITADATIO for the Colony of Victoria. Deat Sir,— It is with very great
pleasure I testify to the inestimable value of Webber's great Herbal Remedy—
VITADATIO. In 1888 I had a severe attack of Gall Stones and Congestion ef the
Liver, which confined me to iriy fcfed for .some;time. The dootor who attended
me said I never would be thoroughly cured ; but I used, to ferl quite well
between the attacks, whiih recurred very often—sometime s two attaoks in one.
Week., In the year 1892 I was very ill with my long-standing trouble, ah9 had
another medical man, spd he told me that Gall Stones could be onred only by
sin deration, Which I Would not consent to. So I continual'in that state till
1896, when another doctor ww; called in, only to tell me the sapie as the
second— that there was no cure in my case but by an operatfoA; go you see that
three able, dootora practically said I could not be eured by the use of
medicine alone. In the month 6f February, 18§7,1 reoeiVed a letter from, my
sister in . Dunedin, New Zealand, telling me of the wonderful cures VITABATIO
had effacted there, and urging me to take a course of this medicine. As soon
as I knew yon had arrived in Melbourne, and that VITADATIO was obtainable in
the colony, acting upon the advice of my sister, I obtained six largesized
bottles of the remedy, and am happy to inform you (and, in fact, the world for
the matter of that) I have been free from pain ever since, and am now in
perfect health; in fact, I am a different being. I may also add that I would
be very pleased to answer any aommunioation relative to my case if addressed
to me. Trusting you may have great success with this Tainable herbal
medicine.—Believe me, yours sincerely, FLORENCE BURK. "" Waimea,"" Pentland-

complication!!. They would genasfit' last froqi three to five weeks,
frequently with aonti pain. Having provided myself with the medfoine.

with complete tuceeu. The acute pain wss at ones relieved, and in three days I
was right again. Sinoe then I had a second attaok, with a like resnlt. If you
