TO

THE KniTOit OF THE ARGUS.

Sir,-A""mn am I constrained to ask you to be good enough to allow me to make
through the agency of your columns, an appeal to the public of Victoria number
to that of the last

two years

It has been decided that the soup kitchen in connection with the Mission of
the Church of England to the Streets and Lanes of the City shall be again
opened The necessity for this is unfortunately only too apparent this season
the need is greater than ever before those that I now 8a> that there never has
been such a season as the one we are passing through, and that there is more
actual poverty and want than most people can possibly imagine It is to try and
in some measure alleviate the suffering that this kitchen is to be opened
During the last two winters it was the means of doing real good and now the
need is much greater Last winter the weekly distribution was upwards of 1400
pints of soup and about 1 200 rolls, and all of the very best quality

the kitchen will be opened at the same place as formerly w , the Deaconesses
Home, 10 Little Lonsdale street east and will be, as  usual, under the
immediate supervision of the resident deaconesses who will be as sisted by a
number of ladies who are always ready to assist in this direction Admission to
the kitchen will be strictly by ticket and it is intended to open it two days
of each week during the extreme winter It is for funds to carry out this work
that I am now appealing I must gratefully acknowledge

the help that has heretofore been so freely given 'W u"" classes and creeds
Though the work is being done under the auspices of a Church of England
institution it is free and open to all and every one that needs the help that
it can afford gets it with  out any questions being asked I am reminded that
there are some kind folks who would gladly give some of the necessary in
gradients in lieu of money Might I say that these will be very welcome The
articles mostly required are pearl barley oatmeal, beef rolls a few bags of
the two former and a regular supply of the two latter would be most useful A
chance is here open to some of our grocers butchers and bakers to do a kindly
action and should any desire to send such they may be sent direct to the home
at the address above given Before the work can begin funds will have to be
provided and earnestly appeal to the charitably disposed to help this work
which in a quiet way, will do much to lighten the heavy loud that so many poor
people have this season to beat

I have to thankfully acknowledge a cheque for ilOfiom our worthy Bishop I
trust many of our more favoured citizens will for low his good example 'Would
you Sir kindly take charge of any amounts that may be forwarded soon I have
been asked to again act as treasurer to the land and any subscriptions sent
either to 1 he Al notice, or to my address as under will be most thankfully
received and all will be acknow- ledged through J he Armi- newspaper

Thanking you in anticipation for inserting this and also for your kindness in
the past -
