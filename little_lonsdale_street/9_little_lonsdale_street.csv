The services of a band and several well-known vocalists have been secured for

society will receive that support which it so well deserves. CENTRAL FBEE

generously co-operate with the promoters of the enterprise. Besides
considerations of charity, others of a social character strongly recommend the
project to general suggort. j.' ST. PATRICK'S COLLEGE.—The distribution of

and that was only fora short time as the effect of them was soon over. They
could not make out what was the e-?lon of the sores that covered all of the
child. Nothing would cure it, only time, they said, but I was not satisfied,
no t tried the Cutirura Soap and Ointment. I had two tablets of Soapn and two

I used the two tablets and the boxes. and all the scabs got cleare, an now he

RES.:

A nasty @ugh :was :cured by SCOTT'S Emulsion and the weak -chest. was
radically strengthened. The mother of the boy, Mrs. K. O'Grady, 2 White Horse
Street, Sydney, N. S. W., writes (20th June,'10) that her son William, 16
months old: "" Sufered grom birth with a weak chest and was constantly troubled
with a nasty cough that kept him awake at night. After - .trying numerous so-
called remedies without success, I' gave Scott's Emulsion. His cough was soon
quite cured, and he has gained so much in wreight that he does ,ot look like
the same child. He is noo perfectly healthy and strong."" Those who try Scott's
Emulsion for coughs and similar. troubles, never go back to those ""so-called
re medies"" mentioned by Mrs. O'Grady. Scott's Emul sion has a world-wide re
putation for curing coughs and colds, and Scott's is the only' emulsion which
has. With Scott's you buy CERTAINTY, and Scott's is the only emulsion you do
buy it with. Therefore, do not ask for ""emulsion "" ask for SCOTT'S Emul sion.
