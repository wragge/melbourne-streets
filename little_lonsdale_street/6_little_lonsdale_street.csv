Labor politicians do so uiucli unacknowledged work, that recognition of the
services of any one of them, is doubly pleasing. During the passage of the
Tarili through the Senate, Senator Findley was instrumental in securing for
type founders such a measure of protection as to stimulate the industry
throughout Australia. Messrs. F. T. Wimble & Co., of tbe Australian Type
Foundry. Sydney*, have named their new series of type ""The Findley,"" in
recognition of the Labor Senator's efforts on behalf of the industry. We have
liad an opportunity of inspecting the new type at the premises of Collie and
Co., Printers' Furnishers, 194-6 Little Lonsdale-street, Melbourne. Mr. Collie
is of opinion that owing to the duty now ruling, type-foundries will shortly
be established in Melbourne.

for Irregularities in the female system, have obtained for it a most extensive
