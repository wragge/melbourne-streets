TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS.

Sir,-Having read in your issue yesterday statements that were given before the
labour board by an employé of Mr. Altson's, of Bourke-street, respecting the
saddle trade of Melbourne, I feel it my duty to contradict several statements
that were made. He stated that saddle-trees could not be made in the colony,
which is untrue. I have made up a great number of saddle-trees this last 20
years, both English and colonial, and I assure you. Sir, that I would not wish
to make up a better tree than Mr. Edwards, of Melbourne and Collingwood and as
for the shape, they far surpass the English tree for making the kind of saddle
required in the colonies. There has been a great deal said about the timber
that is put in the colonial tree, and about their not wearing well ; I can
also deny that, for I have had Baddies back for repairs that have been out for
several years, and had some very rough wear, and they have stood just as well
as the English tree, if not better. He also spoke about the timber being soft
and splitting. I never find them split, and as regards them being soft, all
trees are soft when new, English as well as colonial ; they require to be kept
for a few weeks to allow them to get dry. I can assure you, Sir, it is a great
advantage to have a tree-maker in our midst, for now we are able to make the
exact saddle that gentlemen require, and those that have the colonial-made
tree have just as good an article as the English, when properly made

-Yours, ¡ce, THOMAs BOOTH,

Saddle-manufacturer. 10 Little Bourke-street west, Aug. 15.

At the beginning of this car we published some figures showing the statistical

is taken place, and the most recent quotations show an advance of nearly 20
per cent since the beginning of the year Prices have fluctuated between £100
and £100 for many months, but during this month they have advanced very
rapidly, the quotations to day belief £120 per ton The statistical position of

It will be seen by the above that the total quantity of tin in stock and

nearly 2,000 tons short of that in 1883 The total stocks in Great Britain and

buy up the stocks This, judging from the recent rapid advance in prices, has

maintained for some little time The production from the Straits has not shown
any material increase during the past few years, while the output from
Australasia has been stationary 'The possibility of America becoming a large

increased to a moderate extent by the resumption of work in some of the old

In accordance with the usual custom at shows of the Port Phillip Society, the
adjudication of prizes iu the implement and machinery classes took ylnce
yesterday. This arrangement is an excellent one in tho interests of the public
who will thereby 1-e enabled, on visiting theshowyaiiis to-day, to tiscer tuiu
to what urliolcs the prizsjh ve fallen, without waring, as is the case in
other pa es, until nearly the close of tho show ; and we wonl suggest to the
committee thut a similar arranzem.-.at should be effsat.uA in tha live stock
dei)urtm(-nfc all future

ehovvs. It u perhaps hordly uosessr-ry to state that the site of the present
show is the society's ground -it the junction of the Sydney and Mount
Alexander roids ; but as ground for an extension of the yards has recently
been obtained from the Government, wo may intimate that the proposed
jiitfratinns, which, would have permitted, the intro duction of trials of
huutersaud oilier i-qually popu Itir featurec, have not yet been effected ,
for these tin; public will have to wait another yeur. On en (erir-» the
implement department, a regular visitor of these shows will perhaps remark
wider intorvula between ihn ploughs nud harrows, and more room to move about
through the lines of exhibits. The -implements are certainly fewer than usual,
but in several of tho niachiuery classes we note a decided improvement. This
is more especially tbe case in 4ho important classes comprising reapers nud
mowers, uinougst nhich nre several- that for simplicity, -strength aud real
work, we shonl i imagine wire iiardly susceptible of further improvement. The
workmanship ulso of the mujority is iu lino contrast to that of a tew years
ago ; uud bolh in reapers aud ploughs the superior fiaish of the colonial
article, as compared with the imported, is vory reum-kalle. Tho society having
determined on omhtisig for one year the usual competitive trials of reapers
and mowers, iu order to hold a more ifficieut trial in the follow ing one,
these machines huvo been adjudicated upon in tho yard. It is, however,
perfectly uudeis.ood tuat awards of this character do not carry equal wight
with thoso that result from nctnul work, 'i'he extra class is, as usual, an
interesting oi:o. Amongst *he urticlcs exhibited therein are several which
will jirove popular favorites. The Californian pump in work ; tho hydraulic
jack, by which a weight ol eight tons uiuy be raised with a very slight
expendi ture of strength ; the patent differential blocks, also ?nieaut to
facilitate- tho raising of great weights ; the patent coin screens, which
extract from a vsry foul .sample of grain one that would carry off a prize,
nre amongst the most useful to the class specially interested in shows of this
description. Nor cau we omit Mr Pciryjs tent ami its interesting exhibits of
colonial woods, variously fashioned as they aie by the agency of steam, or by
the art of tho turner, into articles in overy=iiay demand for carriage
building or for the erection of houses. Of these, however, and tho rest of tho
exhibits wo shall give a raoro detailed accouut iu describing tho articles

itauuard, of JShz ibelh-street. As it obtained the firet prize, we may meution
that it has undergone tome improvements at t!ie hands of Mr Boddicgton, which
doubtless contributed to this result. It drove a thresher, uho by Ru&ton; and
Co., tho prico of which on tbo society's catalogue is £210.

Messrs Wilkie, Welch nnd Co. show a four-horse engiue, by Claylon and Co. ;
this is driving a patent noiseless fan ; a circnlar saw mill, and a chaff
cutter. A stcond engine, a six-horse, also by Clayton, drives a thresher by
the same makers, with Bucksham and Underbill's patent elevator. This machine
prepares the grain for market at one operation; the price is £220. Messrs Jus.
Jl'Kwan nnd Co., ElizaWth-strcet. show an tight-horse engine, by Wilson aud
Co., driving one of Horns.lij's prize threshers, which also cleans the grain
in ouce going through it ; tbo price in £215. Mr J. \V. Home has next a six-
horse engine, by Robey, driving a four-horse bone mill, colonial made, a corn
crnsher and a chaff cutter. An American eight-horse thresher, price £C0, is
also exhibited here. Messis T. Robinson and Co. have, first, an eight horse
engiue, by Crarrett and Son. driving Ran some's patent thresher with revolving
screen. Next, an eight-horse engine, hy Ransome, driving a thresher similar to
the last one, but with one of Messrs Robinson's straw eltvators attached to
it. Lisily, a five-norae engine, Uansome's, driving a smaller thresher and a
two-horse Americau thresher, corn crushers, uud a chnff cutter. We now come to
the general exhibits. Mr Josa. Nicholson ohows only two reapers, tho one a
very simple machine with tilting platform and hand back delivery. Tho knifa is
driven direct from the in side of the wheel; there are several minor itn
provements into which wo cannot now enter ; the price of this' machine is £d0.
The second is his lately patented reaper with self-acting side delivery ; a
very excellent machine. The driver being seated outside, his weight serves to
balance the other end .if t!in iimnliiiin. The nower is taken, as in the

previous case, from the insido of the wheel ; the price is £55. A farmer's
waggon of excellent con struction is also exhibited ; it is adapted for
general USB upon farm or road, and is filled with a frame for hay, a set of
very effective breaks, nnd Drabble's patent axles ; price. £G0. Mr Alexander
Finlay, of Colliugwoocl, is on ex hibitor of articles mauufaclured by Messrs
Jack nnd Son, of Maybole, for which firm he is agent He shows a bank d'livery
reaper, with knives of somewhat novel shape, by which clogging is said to be
prevented whether the crop be wet or dry. The srnngement of the mettunibm is
very simple ; the price £-15. A clodcrusLer, a very useful im plement for this
country, has a light frame with tubular iron shafts ; price £18. A roll, with
shaftb of similar construction, is priced £20. There are also grubbers of
several kinds, harrows for general use and olhcrs for grass seeds, together
with corn mills and churns, the whole of Messrs Jack and Son's manufacture. Mr
West, of Esaeudoa, eIiows a lever drill grubber, five tined, with back nnd
front wheels, which oin be raised or depressed at pleasure whilst working ; a
horse hay Take with wheels of improved construction ; a oDe-horte mower and

with self-back delivery, price £30 ; a two-horse two-wheeled reaper and mower,
with iointed coaltor bar of extra length and other

minor improvements, price £15. Another of the same construction, bat of
ordinary width of out, is labelled £43. There are also a reaper of simple
construction, nnd a Buckeye mower of colonial inuke, prica £35 ; a very light
and effective michine both for outs aud grasses. The well-kuown strip ping
machine of this firm, with patent comb, is also there, with winnowing machines
of colonial Eunufacture. Mr Gilbert Alston, of Balla, is an exhibitor of hay
drays, tinnbliug carts, harrows for general use, and tt'Jers for grass seeds.
Mr Mounsey, of Tulla mariue, is also au exhibitor of horse hay rakes. Messrs
Geo. Grant and Co. show, a two-horsn reapir with two wheels and hand-back
delivery, prieo, £15 ; a one-horse reaper, which can he nsed as a self-acting
hand delivery machine at pleasure, price £12 ; a horse hay rake, swing wheel
and sub soil ploughs, drill grubbers, hairows and a vineyard plough. Messrs
Wilkie, Welch and Co. exhibit collections

crops aud for grass seeds, with heavy dray harrows, implements not generally
Been here, and more rarely used than they ought to be. Mr Hugh Leunon, of Bliz
ibeth-stroet, is n new aspiraut to public favor in plough making. He shows
wheel and swing ploughs into which he has introduced several decided
improvements. The articles are very well got up. Mr Lencon also shows a well-
built hay dray of the ordinary kiud. Messrs T. lljbinaon and Co. are, as
usual, ex tensive supporters of the implement and nuchinery departments. They
show a numerous collection of inowerB and reapers, including their newly
designed light grass mower, aduptod specially for English ?grasses. It 13

wheel and the kuife ; the price is £30. Then there ure the wull kiiuwn back-
delivery reaper, the light side-delivery nuchiue, the six-armed reiper, and
ths wood-.'ramed one. They show t-lso a stripping machine, with patent lever
comb. For the first time, ulso, a one-horse drill for grass scccU, of colonial
make is amongst the exhibits. It is remarkably light, having tubular iron
shaftB.

wine press, vice plough, deep trench plough, uud a grape mill, all for
vineyard purposes ; self-li.ling and emptying cauvas buckets for watering stoc
from deep wells ; earth scoops nud wood ploughs for forming dams, ifec. The
Culiforuian pump in operation attracts more attention than anything else in
the yard. It is much used on stations both tor wuiering and washing sheep. The
price is £54, lucludiug tbo horse gear to diive it. Of general tuings we may
add Sellur's ploughs, harrows, horse hoes of colonial muke, rollers, &c.; Mr
J. W. Home shows a patent wool press, with travelling top box, by which the
packing of the wool is greatly facilitated, enabling double the usual quantity
to be packed in a dav. Tho woods

of which it is constructed arc blackwood and Kiurie pine; tho price is £G5. An
iron bucket, self filling and self emptying, for watering stock, is also
shown. Near to this are Westou's differen tial blocks for lifting heavy
weights, and a hydraulic jack to lift as much as eight tons. There ure garden
seats and chairs of the fern tree pattern, with flower-staud3, all made ut the
Vulcan Foundry. The remainder of this firm's exhibits comprise horse works,
chvit cutters, corn crushers, cheese presses, curd mills, and garden rollers.
Mr John Buucle, of Parksido Ironworks, shows his well known priza chaff

NEED ANYONE SUFFER WITH PAIN! MOULTON'S PAIN PAINT IS A CURE FOR EVERT PAIN.
IT.WAS THE FIRST AND IS THE ONLY PAIN REMEDY That instantly stops the most
exorociating pains, allays Inflammation, and cures Congestion, whether of the
Langs, Stomaoh, Bowels, or other Glands or Organs, B¥ ONE APPLICATION, IN FR0B
ONE TO TWENTY MINUTES. No matter how violent or excruciating the pain, the
Rheumatic, Bedridden, Infirm, Crippled, Nervous Nenralgic, or proBtrated with
disease, may Buffer, MOULTON'S PAIN PAINT WILL AFFORD INSTANT EASE.
Inflammation of the Kidneys, Inflammation of the Bladder, Inflammation of the
Bowels, Mumps, Congestion of the Langs, Sore Throat, Difficult
Breathing.,Fblpitation of the Heart, Hysterics, Croup, Diphtheria Catarrh,
Influenza, Headache, Toothache, Neuralgia, Bheumatism, Cold Chills, Ague
Chills, Chilblains, and' Frost Bites. MOULTON'S PAIN PAINT Is simply one of
the wonders of the world. Its effects are little less than marvellous,'; yet
there are soma things that it will not do—it will net cure Cancer, or mend
Broken Bones but, it will always Allay Pain. It has Straightened Fingers,
Cured Chronio Kheumatism of many years' standing, and taken the Pain from
terrible Burns and Scalda which has never been done by any ether article. It
will drive Rheumatism, Sciatioa, and Neuralgia from the system; cures Lumbago,
Pains in the breast or sides ; extraots the poison of Bites and Stings of
Venomous Reptiies; It 8ubrlues Swellings, and Alleviates Pains of every kind;
for Sprains and Bruises it is The Host Potent Bemedy Ever Discovered- The
Proof is the trial. It is reliable. It is handy. It is cheap, and every family
should have it To the Sick and Bedridden, the Lame and Halt, to the Wounded
and Sore, we e&y; COME AND BE HEALED. To the Poor and Distressed (who have
spent their money on worthless medicines) we say— COME AND BE CURED FREE OF
CHARGE. The application of the PAIN PAINT to part or parts where the pain or
difficulty exists will afford ease and comfort. Twenty drops in half a tumbler
of water will, in a few minutes, cure Cramps, Spasms, Sour Stomaoh Heartburn,

MINUTES. NOT ONE HOUR after reading this advertisement NEED ANYONE SUFFER WITH
PAIN! MOULTON'S PAIN PAINT IS A CURE FOR EVERY PAIN. ITIWAS THE FIRST AND IS
THE ONLY PAIN REMEDY That instantly stops the most excruciating pains, allays
Inflammation, and cures Congestion, whether of the Lunge, Stomach, Bowels, or
other Glands or Organs, BY ONE APPLICATION, IN FROfl ONE TO TWENTY 1I1NI1TES.
No matter how violent or ezornciating the pain, the Rheumatic, Bedridden,
Infirm, Crippled, Nervous Neuralgic, or prostrated with disease, may suffer,
MOULTON'S PAIN PAINT WILL AFE0BD INSTANT EASE. Inflammation of the Kidneys,
Inflammation of the Bladder, Inflammation of the Bowels. Mumps, Congestion of

Neuralgia, Rheumatism, Cold Chills, Ague Chills, Chilblains, and Frost Bites.
MOULTON'S PAIN PAINT Is simply one of the wonders of the world. Its effects
are little less than marvellonsl; yet there are some things that it will not
do—it will net cure Cancer, or mend Broken Bones but, it will always Allay
Pain. It has Straightened Fingers, Cured Chronic Kheumatism of many years'
standing, and taken the Pain from terrible Burns and Scalds which has never
been done by any ether article. It will drive Rheumatism, Sciatioa, and
Neuralgia from the system j cures Lumbago, Pains in the breaBt or sides ;
extracts the poison of Bites^and Stings of Venomous Reptiies; it Subdues
Swellings, and Alleviates Pains of every kind; for 8prains and Bruises it is
The Host Potent Bemedy Ever Discovered- The Proof is the trial. It is
reliable. It is handy. It is cheap, and every family should have it To the
Sick and Bedridden, the Lame and Halt, to the Wounded and Sore, we say— COME
AND BE HEALED. To the Poor and Distressed (who have spent their money on
worthless medicines) we say— COME AND BE CURED FREE OF CHARGE. The application
of the PAIN PAINT to part or parts where the pain or difficulty exists will
afford ease and comfort. Twenty drops in half a tumbler of water will, in a
few mioutes, cure Cramps, Spasms, Sour Stomaoh Heartburn, Sick Headache,
Diarrhoea, Dysentery, Colic, Wind in the Bowels, and all Internal Pains.
TRAVELLERS SHOULD ALWAYS CARRY A BOTTLE OF MOULTON'S PAIN PAINT WITH THEM. A
few drops in water will prevent sicknesB or pains from change of water. It is
better than French Brand* or Bitters as a stimulant. ' Sold by all Wholesale
