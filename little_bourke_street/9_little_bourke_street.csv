HOUSES TO BE CLOSED

Sitting at the Law Courts on July 15, the Licences Reduction Board (Messrs H.
Barr, T. Cumming, and J. J. Lock) made known its decision in regard to the
deprivation of licenses in the La trobe and Lonsdale licensing districts.

The Board announced that its de cision was that"" the licensed victual lers'
premises set out below were not necessary for the convenience of the public,
and they would, not have their licences renewed:

LATROBB DISTRICT.

GRAND CENTRAL (late Palace), Bourke

street.

ADAM AND EVE, Little Collins Btreet. ALBURY, Bourke street.

COMMERCIAL, Little Flinders street.

HOTEL AND CAPE CANTON; S wane ton

street.

REFORM CLUB, Little Collins Btreet.

LONSDALB DISTRICT. HOTEL FASOLI, King street.

QUEEN'S MANSIONS, Little Collins street. TAVISTOCK, Little Flinders street. .
TERMINUS, King street.

Mr Barr, the chairman, in announc ing- the decision of the Board, said that
the L&trob;© and Lonsdale licensing districts might fairly be regarded as in
cluding the most important business areas and traffic centres of the metro
polis. Taking: the hotels in the statu tory order, the first to be dealt with
wis the Grand Central, formerly known as the Palace Hotel, in Bourke street.
Three convictions of the class set out in section 44 of Act 2068 were proved
to have been recorded against licensees of this hotel Within the three years
prior to the opening- of the sittings of the Board,

The Board was of opinion that the taking: away of the bar licence of the Cafe
Canton would not materially affect its restaurant tirade.

Including- those in the present list, the chairman continued, the Board had
closed 114 hotels within the city bound ary-leaving out North Melbourne, where
four were closed. Sitting's had still to be held in the Gipps, Bourke,
Cardigan and Prince's Hill districts in 1915 and 1916. Though the Board did
not expect to be able to -close by the end of 1916 all the unnecessary hotels,
it would be seen from the following list that substantial reductions had been
made in many of the leading' streets: Bourke street 12, Little Lonsdale street
9, Little Bourke street 8, Little Collins street 8, King street 8, Lonsdale
street 7, Flinders lane 5, Swanston street 4, Bouverie street 4, Elizabeth
street 3, Flinders street 3, Spencer street 3, Ex hibition street 3, a'Beckett
street 3, Drummond street 3, Latrobe street 2, Queen street 2, William street
2, Vic toria street 2, Palmerston street 2, Queensberry street 2. and 19 In
various other streets. With the eight closed in Colling~wood, the total number
de prived of licences in the city and inner suburban area was now 202, and the
total up to date in the State 785.

This event, which came off on Wednesday at the Exhibition building, as usual,
will not hereafter be referred to as one of the society's successes. Its
former exhibitions of grain and farm produce, though not nominally champion
shows, have usually partaken of that character, for many of the first prize
exhibits at country shows have, in former

years, been sent to compete with one another. On the present occasion,
however, the competition in wheat, oats, and barley was of the most limited
description ; indeed, we do not remember a metro politan show in which the
grain classes were so sparingly supplied. Of the quality we are enabled to
report far more favorably, although nei ther of the three principal cereals
showed any thing remarkable in weight. In the Mel bourne district, grain
growing is very nearly extinct, and accordingly the society has chiefly to
depend on contributions from other parts of the colony. Of the four samples of
wheat, that shown by Mr Orlebar, of Tooram, near Allansford, in the
Warrnambool district, came off with first prize ; the weight was 66½lb per
bushel. The second prize sample, weight 66¼ lb, was grown by Mr Matthews,

of Coghill's Creek ; both were Tuscan, and very good wheats. Tartarian oats
were represented by three very fair lots, the best of which weighed 44lb per
bushel. Oats of other varieties had a solitary representative, called Cape
oats, about as foul and weedy a lot as was ever exhibited, and to which the
judges, most erroneously, we think, gave a first prize. The first prize barley
affords an opportunity of comparing the weighing of the Port Phillip with that
of the Lancefield and Kilmore Society. Mr Wil liam Cox's barley took the first
prize at both shows; at Lancefield it was reported to have weighed 60 lb 4 oz
per bushel ; at Melbourne, when measured with due care and precaution, it
weighed only 58½ lb. The most promising item in the grain department was the
malt. Both of the prize samples were much better than previously shown

in Melbourne. Mr Elliott's, of Sandhurst, took the first prize, with a sample
that would brew good pale ale; Messrs Gough and Co., of Melbourne, were
second. The Russian wheat of Mr A. Martelli, with its odd-looking black beard,
was the object of many inquiries. Its weight, however, was only 63 lb, a fair
result for the first year after importa tion. Mr Bencraft showed some capital
exhibits in maizemeal, oatmeal, prepared groats and barley ; and Messrs Urie,
Munn and Young their various preparations from maize, consisting of maizena,
blue and white starch, &c.; Of pulse and agricultural seeds, the principal
exhibits were contributed by Messrs Law, Somner and Co., of Swanston street.
Their collection of agricultural seeds was really a permanent feature of the
show, and was highly creditable to that enter prising firm. Mr M'Laren, of
Gisborne, also ex hibited a fine sample of rye grass, but there were no other
seeds shown by growers. The show of roots was rather short, but finer mangolds
than those of Mr Turner of Keilor were never exhibited at Mel bourne. It was
anticipated, but we know not on what grounds, that grapes and wines would be
pro minent features of the show. On reference to the prize schedule, we see
nothing to justify such an expectation, a miserable forty shillings being the
amount of the first prizes in each class. The white wine of Mr Maplestone was
certainly not worthy of special distinction ; the reds, however, were better,
and in this Mr Walter Clarke was placed first, and Mr Mapleston second. Grapes
were like the wine, few, and of moderate quality. Un questionably the best
department in the show was that which included dairy produce, and the cause of
its being so is obvious. At the society's October show, three prizes of 20
sovs. each were announced to be awarded at the autumn grain show, for the best
5 cwt. each of butter, cheese, bacon and hams ; and further inducements were
not wanting, Mr M'Caw, of the Royal Horse Bazaar, Bourke street, having
liberally placed at the dis posal of the society two challenge cups, value £20
each, for the best samples of cheese and butter. The conditions required the
delivery of the butter, bacon, and hams by the 1st December, with a view to
test their keeping qualities. The exhibits of butter, five in number, were
certainly not up to the mark, the first prize sample alone being, really
creditable. The judges of bacon and hams, too, re fused to certify for a prize
for these ; they certainly looked inviting enough, but were reported as im
perfectly cured, which is not very surprising, seeing that the work of curing
must have been performed during the heat of summer. The exhibitors were Messrs
Thomas Bridgett, Bal laarat ; John Farmer, Ballaarat ; and Watson and
Patterson, of Northcote. The cheese, however, was a fine display, both as to
quantity and quality ; and, if such cheese was forthcoming in quantity, the
colonv miffht soon dispense with imnortations.

There were no less than twelve exhibitors, of 5 cwt each, Mr Orlebar, the
winner of the wheat prize, being also the fortunate winner of the £20 prize
and Mr M'Caw's challenge cup. The double honors in butter fell to Mr David
M'Aulay, of Whittlesea, on the Upper Plenty. In the class for extras, the
artificial manure firms mustered very strongly. Messrs M'Meikan and Co. and
Messrs Collins and Co. showed specimens of their various manufactures from
bones. The two guano firms, Messrs Gustave, Beckx and Co, and the Flat Island
Company were also strongly represented; and the owners of hop grounds and
vineyards were specially invited to consider the claims of mungo or shoddy,
manufactured by Messrs Davis, Finlayson and Hutchinson, of A'Beckett street.
Further, in the extra class, we must not forget Mr Learmonth's hops ; the
specimens of Italian hemp grown by Mr Montelli ; silk by Mr Darbyshire, of
Beechworth ; and the. very pretty straw hat, made entirely from colonial
materials, by Mrs Mealy, of Collingwood, a placard attached to which informed
the visitor that it was not only made of colonial straw, but sewn and tied
with colonial silk and trimmed with the down of black swans and feathers of
the emu. The dressed flax and flax seed of Mr John Craig, of Moolap, Geelong,
was a very interesting product, showing, as it does, what can be done with a
crop now coming into general favor. In connection with this, we must not omit
to draw attention to a consignment of flax seed just received by Mr W. Grant,
of 9 Little Bourke street west, two bags of which were shown on Wednesday, but
came too late for competition. We need hardly say that Messrs Robinson and Co.
showed their fine collection of grape mills, presses and implements suitable
for vineyards ; and Mr Buncle his well-known chaffcutters. The attend ance
during the day was not large, but at two p.m. his Excellency Sir Charles
Darling, attended by his aide-de-camp, arrived at the building, and spent a
considerable time in examining the various pro ducts. Refreshments and
lunoheon were supplied in the building, by the proprietor of Williams' Hotel.

2nd August, 1906, at Burns-street, Maryborough. The face we loved it now lies
low, The fond true heart is still; the hand that often clasped in ours, Lies
still death's cold chill. The weary hours and days of pain. The troubled,
sleepless nights are past; The ever patient worn out frame Has gained eternal
rest at last. -Inserted by his loving wife and family. BEREAVEMENT NOTICES.
MRS. ELLIS and FAMILY return THANKS to all neighbors all neighbors and friends
of the late Thomas Stevens during the last few months of his long life. God
bless you all in well-doing.

""Why do some children always look so Healthy Cardwell?""

Q

ALGIERS

is the

answer

The surest way to keep children healthy and robust and able to go out in all
weathers without any ill after-effects-is to

build up their powers of resistance with Angler's Emulsion.

Angler's is endorsed by the medical profession and used in children's
hospitals throughout the country. It is a soothing, pleasant emulsion, with
unique tonic and building properties. For colds, coughs, whooping-cough,
bronchitis and all chest affections for scrofula, rickets, or any wasting
disease it is invaluable. If children are weakly and run-down after measles

or a fever, Angler's quickly restores strength and hastens recovery. For the
child with a poor appe U and weak digestion, Anglers is the ideal tonic
because it soothes the digestive tract and helps the diges-

tive process. . of

Children all like it and take j

willingly. Let your child has a regularly - it is unequalled in giving extra
strength and stamina.

The modern idea is ....

The modern idea in face powders is .. Charmosan face powder.

The shrieking obviousness of powder upon one's skin in days gone by is a
painful recollection only with the women of to-day, for the famous Charmosan
face

powder has set a new standard in skin .

charm.

To-day women ask this of their face powder:

""Conceal any faults you find in my skin. I but don't proclaim to the World you
are a doing it stay on for hours so that I I need not be everlastingly putting
you on no matter what I am doing . . . make my skin look young and pretty ...
be on my skin, but make people wonder whether you are there or not ."" that's
what the women of to-day ask of their powder.

And if Charmosan face powder could speak it would say . . . ""Use me! I say
yes' to all your demands.""

The New Aladdin

The old narrative of Aladdin and his wonderful Lamp is an entrancing story of
mythical adventure intended generally for children; but our story is no fairy
tale. In the old-world yarn the wily magician took advantage of the inability
of the foolish princess, but in our recently acquired role of The New Aladdin
we give all the advantage to the wise and youthful wives of the community.

Read on in the panel where we speak in greater

detail.
