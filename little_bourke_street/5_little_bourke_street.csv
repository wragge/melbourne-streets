FRUIT ESSENCES

. ""The Argus cameraman takes you this week behind the scenes at the Kensington
works of Alfred Lawrence and Co. Ltd., of 561-5 Little Bourke street,
Melbourne, and shows how

delicious Australian fruit is converted into ""Blue Ark"" concentrated fruit
essences. To the general public the name ""essences"" signifies those
preparations, such as essence of vanilla, used in the kitchen for flavouring
purposes. The function of the essence manufacturing trade goes further than
this, an important part of its business being to supply concentrated
flavouring to the manufacturers of foodstuffs. ""Blue Ark"" concentrated
essences give delicious flavouring to many foodstuffs and beverages,
manufacturers having  

proved the reliability of ""Blue Ark"" products over a period of many years.

1 Citrus fruit is automatically handled by this specially constructed machine.
The fruit is fed to a continuous conveyor, which carries it into the machine,
where it is cut into   sections and the peel and albedo separated from the
pulp by means of specially designed   devices which remove the peel from the
fruit and gently squeeze the pulp By this method most of the fruit cells
remain in the juice, the seeds and core being removed.

2 A line of evaporating pans show-

ing the flues which draw off the vapours and ensure perfect ventila- tion
throughout the works.

3 Left -- Some of the special

vacuum stills which by pro-

cessing at low temperatures enable  

the essential flavours of the fruit

to be extracted without injury to   their finer properties.

4 Left. - Another view of the

vacuum pans at the ""Blue Ark""   works.

5 Bottling essences and labelling and packing bottles for despatch.

6 Commercial consumers and large users of essences purchase their

requirements in these demijohns.

""7 At all stages of manufacture the essences are examined and checked by

chemists having specialised training and qualifications. These specialists
have wide experience in the production, concentration, and conservation of all
varieties of flavours, and of their application to the essence-using
industries.

8 Section of the special research laboratory at the ""Blue Ark"" works. Research
related to concentrated flavours has two principal functions: To make
available to foodstuff manufacturers the best flavour value that the money set
aside for that purpose can buy, and to discover and develop

new flavours.

cases were be fore the Court last Thursday his Honor granted declarations in
connection with four of the

applications, but the reeb wore postiponeo until to-day, so that tho owners
may file answering affidavits. The first, application to bo dealt with
yesterday was in respect to No. 1.73-5 Little Bourke street, and Air. OTTara
Wood, who appeared for the Crowri, argued that tbo tenants had no right to
appear. His Honor pointed out that a brother judge had held that tonants wcro
entitled to bo represented by counsel, and ho would not depart from that
decision. Ho would thercfor-e overrule counsel's objection. Air. Coldham. who
ap peared far the owner (Mr. Miller), stated that hia client had no knowledge
that his property was being used by his tenant for gambling purposes. When he
became awaro of tho fact, ho cancelled tho lease ; and in the now leaso the
tenant had entered into a bond of £50 witth his landlord that the premises
would no: bo used for illegal gambling. He pointed cut that the tenant bad
sifh-let a room to another person, andlt woe in this room that gambling was
carried, on. His Honor ruled that if the owner would enter infio a bond of £50
and tho tenant! into ono of £200, ho would decline to issue the declaration.
In the cases of No. 234, 236 and 238 Little Bourke street his Honor fixed1
bonds at £10 in each case. The property situated at No. 195 LittJo Bourko
street belonged to a wealthy Chinese socio! iy, which lot tho house to Aih
Gooey, who sub-lEit ono room, to a Chinese club. It was stated that tho club
had now vacated the premises. His Honor fixed bonds at £150 for tho owners aud
<£108 for the tenant. Tho hearing of two other cases was ad journed for a
fortnight. In tho cas?i of the premise) situated at 244 Little Bourke stroet
it was explained that tho owners were tho Chineeo Kang Chew Society. Mr. Ah
TCet,

wno appeareu lor tne owners, saici mo owners denied that, ihey knew gambling
was carried on there. Ho supposed that no difference would bo made between
that sooioty er tho othor. This remark was resented by his Honor, who with
eomo warmth raid that he mado no distinction. ""The next time,"" ho continued,
""you suggest that tho court is mak ing a distinction between country,
nationality or creed, you wil! be asked to repeat it and bo sent somewhere
eke. It is a sugges tion that tho court is not doing its duty."" Counsel
apologised, and his Honor fixed the bond at £200 by tho owner.?. In the case
of tho premises at 16 Hefferman lane, Mr. Duffy, who appeared for the owners,
Chinese Shang hai Society, maintained that the information did not disclose
sufficient grounds. The in formant only had reason to suspect gambling on the
word of others: His Honor thought tho grounds wcro sufficient, as it was sworn
by the agents of the polico, nnd they had seen gambling conducted there. After
further ar guments, the case was referred to the Full Court. An application to
rescind the declara tion made against the premises at 243 Little Bourko street
was made by the tenant, who filed an affidavit that lie had sub-let a room
whero gambling was conducted by the occupier without his knowledge. The
occupier of tho room had now left and (he tenant agreed to enter into a bond
that gambling would not bo conducted there in future. His Honor granted tho
application.

1st, Tho value of property in the business parts of the city will, we think,
continue at rate certainly not below the present one.

2nd. The fluctuations in the value of city property will not be again affected
as strongly as it has been by the gold finds, whatever may be their yield.

3rd. The prosperity of the colony is unpre cedented-perfectly natural and
healthy.

4th. There has been and still is, a super-

abundance of wealth

5th. The wealth of the colony is not repre sented by heaps of worthless paper
money, but by

A Hundred Tons of Solid Gold.

It is therefore the prudent capitalist whose interest it is to pick up such
purchues us the

above.

Sure of a rental now, and no doubt of a better shortly ; indeed in what way
can his money be more profitably employed than upon 'dty first-class property,
situated in such a thoroughfare as this in.

It has been analytically proved in London that the world produces no finer
lavender than that grown on the Bridestowe Lavender Estate in Tasmania.

In sachets of light or dark mauve at 6d. each, mauve velvet, silk lined
handkerchief wallets make an attractive gift at 44 each, and Bridestowe
Lavender can be obtained in numerous other novelties as well as in the famous
lavender

water.

Ask your chemist or retailer for our illustrated price list. It will help you
to choose suitable gifts at suitable prices.
