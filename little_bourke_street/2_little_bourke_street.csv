A representative meeting of the Catholic members o! the Police Force who are
subscribers to the fund was held at the Cathedral Hall, . Bruns wick-street,
Fitzroy, on the 29th ult.,. Inspector Curtin in the chair. The secretary
submitted a list showing 'amounts received from the

different police stations throughout the State. Considering the high cost of
living, and the many calls made on the members of the force, the sum
subscribed was considered highly satisfactory. The chairman announced that the
amount would have been much greater were it not for the fact that many members
had already subscribed in their parish churches. It was resolved Lo place or
erect a suitable memorial in the chapel as a testimonial of esteem and
admiration from the Catholic members of the Police Force. Hav ing ascertained
that the chapel would not be erected for two or three years, it was decided to
place the money in the Savings Bank in the name of two trustees. Senior-
Constable McGlade and Con stable Salts were appointed cotrus tees, and the
amount has been placed to their credit in the bank. As it was considered that
the pro posed memorial should be something substantial, in harmony with the
chapel, and calculated to redound to the credit of the donors, it was re
solved to make another appeal to members in 18 months' time, when it will be
decided what form the me morial should take. Other projects for augmenting the
fund were taken

mto consideration. The following is a copy of the list from the various police

Carr Memorial \- Chapel Fond

A representative meeting of the Catholic members of the Police Force, who are
subscribers to the fund, was held at (he Cathedral Hall, Brnnswick street,
Fitzroy, 011 the 29th ult. In spector Curtin was in the chair. The secretary
submitted a list showing

amounts received irom tlie (Intercut police stations throughout the State.
Considering the high cost of living and the many calls made 011 the members of
the force, the stun subscribed was con sidered highly satisfactory. The chair
man announced that the amount would have been much greater were it not for the
fact that many members had already subscribed in their parish churches. It was
resolved to place or erect a suitable memorial in the chapel as a testimonial
of esteem and admira tion from the Catholic members of the Police Force.
Having ascertained that the chape! would not lie erected for two or three
years, it was decided to place the amount in the' Savings^ Bank in the name of
two trustees; Senior Constable McGlade and Constable Salts were ap pointed co-
trustees, and the money has been placed to their credit in the bank. As it was
considered that the proposed memorial should be something sub stantial, in
harmony with the chapel, and calculated to redound to the credit of the
donors, it was resolved to make another appeal to members in eighteen months'
time, when it will be decided what form the memorial should take. Other
projects for augmenting the fund were taken into consideration. The following
