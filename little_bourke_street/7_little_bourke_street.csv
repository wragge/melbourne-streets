Mr. J. AIcColl, a passer-by, who iw clouds of smoke issuing l'rom tho build

firemen from Eustern Hill, William- street and Sva not on-strcet wore at the

The Assembly meets this afternoon. The preliminary business is a question by
Mr. M 'Lilian, in reference to an amendment of the Civil Service Act, with a
view to con ferring upon civil servants the rights which that measure was
intendtd to convey. Mr. Curtain has a proposal to submit as regards

the appointment of Commissioner of Titles, a vacancy being made by tbe
retirement of Mr. Carter. The other notices do not in volve any question of
public importance. Hie estimates for tlie year will be proceeded with after
the refreshment hour. A petition has been forwarded to the Executive by George
Rutchart, praying that his ease may be taken into consideration. He adverts in
the document to the circum stances of bis trial, and points out that from the
evidence then given it was apparent that, whatever the etate of his mind might
have been at the time the offence with which he was charged was committed, he
had since

fully recovered his right mind, and there fore prayed for his discharge. Tlie
cose is still uniler the consideration of the Govern ment. In another column
will be found a list of collections made on Hospital Saturday and Sunday
additional to those which appeared in yesterday's issue. The amount now re
ported is £3134 2s. 8£d., but this will be considerably added to when
statements of the amounts of all the collections made and to be made have been
received. The time when the drum-head parades of yarious corps of vo lunteers
will be held is yet in abeyance, pend ing tlie decision of the Colonel-
Commandant. Captain Swallow is desirous that volunteers generally should
attend the parade on the Sandridge pier, and he wishes it to be fixed for a
different day from the parade of the Naval Reserve, under Captain Fullarton,
so that they may not clash. The parade of the East Melbourne corps will
probably take place on Sunday next. It is also intended to give the service of
sacred song in the Royal Park on Sunday next if the weather will permit. 'iha
New Zealand Times, 14thinst., says that ""Mr. Vogel anticipates to be back iu
Wel lington within five or six months of the date of his departure."" From the
Sydney Empire it appears that Messrs. Parkcs and Vogel have been engaged in
daily conference since tbe arrival of the latter in Sydney, but nothing bos
transpired of their delibera tions. in its leading article prepared for the
out going Califormon mail, the Sydney Morning HeraVl of the 25th inst. has the
following respecting the continuance of the service : — "" Tlie Cyphrenes, that
takes this month's mail to San Francisco, runs in virtue of an arrangement
made by the Government of New South Wales, with a view to maintain the Pacific
route uninterrupted. New South Wales has taken upon itself to keep this mail
route open, and the Cyphrenes has been chartered by tho Australasian Steam
Navigation Company, with whom the Go vernment has made an arrangement for the
transmission to England for this month's mails, as also for the return trip.
Mr. Rus sell, the New Zealand representative, has arrived, and what is still
Letter, he is ac companied by Mr. Vogel, who is en route for Europe. But
whatever New Zealand may do, it is scarcely probable that the ser vice will be
abandoned by New South Wales, its utility as a passenger route, and also as a
mail route, having now been suf ficiently established. It has been shown
conclusively that when no special cause of delay intervener, the passage from
Sydney to San Francisco, calling at Fiji and Honolulu, can be performed in
thirty days, and the rest of the journey in eighteen. With a properly
organised service, and with proper boats, this could be regularly done month
after month, and, being done, would furnish us with a convenient alternative
fortnightly mail."" On tlie 15th instant Messrs. M'Meckan and Blackwood's
steamer Claud Hamilton, outward bound to Kew Zealand, came into collision with
the light-ship in the West Channel, which was damaged to the extent of £70.
The mfctter was brought under the notice of the Pilot Board, who held an
inquiry yesterday. After a sitting of two hours, during which the evidence of
those on board the steamer and tbe light-ship was taken, the board ar rived at
the following decision : — "" The Pilot Board, having taken the evidence into
con sideration, and having heard what the master of the Claud Hamilton hod to
say, is of opinion that the collision with the West Channel light-ship arose
from the default of Captaiu Bawden in neglecting to take tlie ne cessary
precaution in navigating his vessel in entering the West Channel on the 15th
instant, and for this default the board sus pend his exemption certificate as
a pilot for two calendar months."" The repairs to the light-ship have been made
by tbe Govern ment, Messrs, M'Meckan, Blackwood and Co. paying the cost. The
National Agricultural Society of Vic toria held their adjourned monthly
meeting yesterday. Present— the hon. Robert Sinison, M.L.C. (president), in
the chair; Messrs. M'Culloch, Cochrane, Fisken, Carson, Hammond, Morton, Bell,
Job Smith, M'Pbail, Robertson and W. Taylor. A letter was received from the
Beudigo Agricultural Society, requesting this society to appoint a judge of
horses for their forth coming show, to be held on the 21st October. The
council declined to take such a responsi bility, but instructed tbe secretary
to for ward tbe names of a few gentlemen named by them, members of the
society, well- known judges, for selection. The stock salesmen applied for
leave to sell ex hibits in the yards on Tuesday, the second day of the show,
but the council were of opinion that such sale should not be held until
Wednesday, . the third and last day. A letter was received from Messrs. P. and
J. G. Brisbane, of Berwick, wishing the names of the judges in the various to
be published. The secretary was instructed to answer that the . list of judges
would be given to the various journals for publication as soon as accept

ande had been received. The committee ap pointed to take into consideration
the altera tion of tho Dog Act were not quite prepared with their report. For
tho benefit of owners of stock to bo exhibited at the forth coming show,
cattle from a distance can be roceivod in tho yards, St. Kilda-road, any time
during the previous week. The secre tary was instructed to call for tenders -
for the supply of refreshments, band, forage, covering pene, Sc., for the
show. A clever magician and wonderful lamp, or magic lantern, appeared in the
Insolvent Court yesterday. Mr. James M'Kinley, once a magician, once a
herbalist, and lately a col lector, appeared in the box as an insolvent, a
fate which neither herbB, magis lantern, collections nor cabalistic feats
appeared to have saved him from. The manner of his insolvency, however, is
somewhat curious. In 1S72 a Mrs. Morgan obtained a verdict against the man of
mysteries for trespass, tho court awarding her £10 damages. Two days after'
'this eventful circumstance M'Kinley gave' a UU of kale over his fur niture
for £200 to a Mr. Fielding, in which was included the wonderful lamp. Ml.
Fielding paid over £160 of the £200 to a Mr Rourke, to satisfy a mortgago he
held over insolvent's property. The remaining £40 was spent in law costs and
personal ex penses by insolvent, though he could not specify what law expenses
he had incurred. Insolvent's schedule was prepared in his (insolvent's) house
by a man whose name he did not know. Mr. Fielding, a batcher, who lent the
insolvent £200, said he would lend money to anybody he liked ; and, although
the furniture on which he secured himself was not worth £20, he (Fielding)
would have lent the insol vent the money without any security at aU. Mr.
George Rourke, who was paid £1G0 by Fielding on insolvent's behalf, Baid he
had in his possession at the present time the identical £160 paid to him in
1872. By way of Sydney we have intelligence from Kew Caledonia to the 9th
inst. The Moniteur of tho 2nd give3 n full account of the sentences passed
upon all those who were supposed to have assisted in the escape of ltochefort
and his companions. The official part of tbe Moniteur of the 9th September
gives the decision which expels from the colony Madame Juliette Lopez, who
arrived at Noumea on the 23rd of October, 1873, by the merchant vessel
Fenelon, for "" holding a behavior contrary to good order,"" ..and al lows her a
delay of three days to prepare for her departure. The Sydney Morning Herald
reports that a deputation, consisting of the hon. J. L. Moutefiore, Mr. T. S.
Mort, the lion. -Edward ,K. C'ox, and'Mr. Joubert, waited upon the-' Colonial
Secretary on 24th inst., to ask the assistance of the Government in bringing
about a representation of the products of Kew South Wales at the Exhibition to
open at Philadelphia on the 19th of April, 1876. It was stated that South
Australia and Vic toria had both remitted the matter to com missions, and it
was extremely desirable that a small commission should be appointed iu Sydney,
to bring about a united repre. sentation of Australian resources. It was esti.
mated tbat the total cost for the whole of the colonies would probably not
exceed £10,000 or £12,000 ; and that by the united action proposed the display
would be much more effective, and would be brought about at the minimum of
cost. It would only be neces sary that one gentleman should be sent to take
charge of the collection ; and, so far as Victoria and South Australia were
concerned, gentlemen there had volunteered . to pay their own expenses, and to
look after the interests of the colonial departments, .whioh their governments
would arrange for in the Australasian court. It was thought that £2500 would
be sufficient to procure the re presentation of Kew South Wales, Mr. Parkes
said that he would communicate with the Governments of the neighboring
colonies with a view to ascertain what they proposed to do, and he would
submit the matter to his colleagues in the course of next

week. An extraordinary vacano# haying occurred in the Hawthorn Borough Council
by the re signation of Cr. Harston, two candidates have been nominated to fill
tbe seat- Messrs. William Thomas Molloy, M.D., and Arthur Goddard Utber. The
polling is fixed to take place on Thursday, 8th Octo ber. At a special meeting
of the council last evening, Cr. Sayce was unanimously elected mayor for the
remainder of the municipal year, in plaoe of Mr. J. S. Denny, resigned. For
the extraordinary vacancy in the Kew Borough Council, caused by the
resignation of Councillor Siddeley, two candidates have been nominated, viz.,
Messrs. Francis Bowyer Miller and Bernard Macartney. The election is appointed
to take place on 10th proximo. The letter of Mr. Amess in reply to the ""
Limeburners and Lime Merchants"" will be found in our fourth page. A deputation
waited on Mr. Parkes in Syd. ney, on the 24th inst., askirg that the restric
tions which the Imperial Act for the suppres sion of
kidnappinghadimposedupontheSouth Sea Island trade might bo modified. Mr.
Parkes said that the trade was carried on where there could be no supervision
by a civilised community— where there was no Dress, no courts, no police. It
was a portion of the world which wns likely every day to become more and more
important, and where facilities existed for gigantio vices, such as man
stealing and wholesale murder. The Government were very anxious that no in
jury should be done to trading interests out of Sydney, and they were prepared
to do all they could to protect them. '' They would make representations to
the Imperial Govern ment, and would also consider whether any thing could be
done by coloniM' legisla tion. ' - From the Star wo learn that a ""gentleman
well known on Ballarat wrote to \the Im perial Government as soon as' the
wonderful auriferous richness of Ashantee was made known, to ascertain what
inducements and facilities would be . offered to miners pro- ceeding to the
Gold Coast, who would in troduce powerful machinery -for mining pur poses, and
otherwise open up the country ; and by the last mail he received a reply, of
which the following is the principal portion ; — ' Downing-street, 25th July,
1874.- — Sir, — I -am directed by the Earl of Carnarvon to acknowledge the
receipt of your letter of the 18th of May, on the subject of mining enter
prise in the Gold Coast Proteotorato. In reply to your inquiries, I am to
acquaint you that the Grown is not the owner of the soil in any part of the
Gold Coast Protectorate, except on the immediate seaboard, and is not,
therefore, in a position to make grants of land, or concessions for working
it. I am further to observe that her Majesty's Government would be disposed to
look favorably upon any well- considered plans for the introduction of capital
and commercial enterprise into the Gold Coast Protectorate, and would with
hold no proper or reasonable facilities to that end which it might be in their
power to afford. But it is only right that persons contemplating any
investment or under taking witbin the ' protectorate should be aware that, in
the opinion of her Majesty's Government, there may be, independently of tbe
risks of climate, many obstacles to the success of such enterprises, as
regards the supply of labor, and native rights in land and minerals. Kor is it
to be forgotten that, in conseqnenoe of the recent war, the country is, and
for some time to come must remain, unsettled and disturbed. In view of these
considerations, Lord Carnarvon can not take upon himself the responsibility of
advising or encouraging, at the present time, an enterprise of the nature
contemplated. (Signed) Robert Geo. Herbert.' "" The recent investigation at the
Sole special land board appears to have created quite a stir amongst the
dummies and their em ployers. The Gipps Land Mercury states tbat ""men hove
been searched for over various parts of the colonies, and placed at great
expense upon their selections, and im provements are being rushed up on lands
that have been nntoncbed since their selec tion. Among the reports that have
reached us is the following : — ' One man sent bis servant, or dummy, to place
a billy and pan nikin in a but on a selection, thinking that if the bailiff
chanced to pass the few sheets of bark, and see the well-known cooking
utensils, he would be satisfied as to the ' re sidence' ; but, unfortunately,
the bona fide selector forgot to light a fire and leave the ashes, and also
forgot to blacken tbe billy, and it is more than probable the bailiffs have
been more than once to the place.' "" The Pastoral Times has been informed ""
that the Deniliquin and Moama Railway project will be launched in the London
money market. The necessary documents go home by the next outgoing mail."" Mr.
Ramsay, Postmaster-General, yester day received a deputation from the Borough
Council of Hotham, accompanied by Mr. Muhro and Mr. Curtain, M.L.A.'s, on the

Better . . . in fast, clean milking ... in economical trouble- free service
... as an investment for any progressive dairy farmer. And the two new
features that stand behind this claim are Bertram's new Pulsator and new Teat
Cup. The PULSATOR is of the mechanical positive drive type in an almost
unwearable metal, specially machined and finished to ensure exceptionally
smooth working. The drive, an eccentric and thrust rod, gives absolutely
uniform pulsation, ? and constitutes the only moving part. £ The TEAT CUP is a
revelation. It recreates, exactly, the f ' sucking action of the calf,
ensuring easy and natural milking. Besides maintaining the milk yield, it
milks strippers, keeps in position, is easily cleaned, and cannot harm the
cows. t . These two features combine to give perfect mechanical t 1 milking.
Years of experience and actual test stand behind jt,- them, and the materials
and workmanship throughout the u whole machine are of the best. ||i Inspect
this new plant yourself, or, if desired, a complete, well-illustrated booklet
of the New Bartram All-Mechanical Milker will be sent to you on request. «
