TO SUFFERERS FROM RHEUMATISM

Read the following letters and you will  learn how relief may be obtained -

From Mr W H Mitchell 6 Pitt street

Adelaide SA

For years I suffered from chronic rheu- matism The pain in his limbs was ex
consisting The seat of the pain was not fixed but would be transferred from
one

joint to another At times my knees became  stiff After having tried various
means of obtaining relief I got some Warner's Safe Cure After I had taken a
few bottles of the medicine the pains vanished and I could again get
refreshing sleep Mr recovery

was a great surprise to me I can strongly recommend Warners Safe Cure to
anyone suffering as I did

from Mrs Emma Merino Square Town

Port Pirie S -i

For many years I laboured under great bodily debility and acute rheumatism
Most excruciating ] runs would seize me more especially during change of
weather the pains would extend from the hips right down to the ankles and were
also in my arms At such times I was unable to get any sleep day or night My
muscles be came emaciated and in consequence my limbs would lose their power
of motion I tried many remedies without effect Ultimately my attention was
called to Win ners Safe Cure which give me relief from the first 1 ottle I
continued to take the  medicine for some weeks when the violent cracking pains
ceased entirely and I was able to get about and attend to my business as well
as ever I have known of others who have taken Warner's Safe Cure with the same
good result

W Warner s Safe Cure is sold by chemists and storekeepers everywhere both in
the original (5s) bottles and in the cheaper (26)

till 2 daily. 20 Jul 24

MR. BAMFORD, SURGEON-DENTIST (from'

Pimlico, London), in acknowledging the kind recommendations of his patients,
assures them that every exertion will still be made that science and capital
can command to ensure perfect success in each case undertaken by him, and that
moderate charges will be strictly adhered to.

To persons that have not visited Mr. Bamford, it may here be remarked that the
ENAMELLED MINERAL TEETH supplied by him are of the most beautiful form and
color, to match the adjoining the th to perfection, and am be used with the
greatest comfort, restoring articulation, mastication, and the proper contour
of the Ups.

If tartar has been allowed to accumulate upon the teeth It should be removed
by the dentist. Com paratively few persons are aware of its injurious effects.
Its presence may easily be detected by the field breath, the disagreeable and
disgusting severance that it imparts to the teeth, as well as the diseased
state of the gum?, bleeding very readily when an attempt is made to brush the
teeth. Aliorptionof thousand sockets is the result, until the teeth fall out,
having lost their natural support. 3 The operation of scaling the tooth is
painless, and is quite within persons' own power to keep them clean forwards,
so that no excuse can be made for peace, till discoloured or dirty teeth.

0 he operation of stopping decayed teeth is frequently performed in so
careless a manner as to be utterly meters. To avoid this, a respectable
dentist must be employed The affected tooth should be attended to it. as early
a Binge of decay as possible and If tim caries be scientifically and carefully
removed, and the cavity plugged with gold, or an indestructible com position
(according to the extent of the disease) the teeth will then be rendered as
useful as over, and will 11 train so for many years. The importance of timely
intention to the teeth will be acknowledged when we consider the injurious
effects on the constitution of the poisonous and found gases, generated by the
deer imposing animal matter during the destruction of the tooth, that are
inhaled by the lungs at every level return, consequently seriously impairing
the generally milk. This fact is perhaps not sufficiently attended to by the
medical practitioner.
