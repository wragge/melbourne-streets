At the City Police Court, to-day, before Mr Sturt, P.M., five Chiuamen were
summoned for taking part in the. management of tho Chinese lottery, known as
No 3 Bank on the I nth innt. Thn dr-fi-ndftiita were named

Shing Zeu, Ah Goon, Ah Wah, Gee Leah, and Ah Liu, and the summons read as
follows : — "" Whereas an information and comnlaint hath this day boon laid
before the under signed, one of Her Majesty's justices of the peace within and
for the central bailiwick ' of the colony of Victoria, by one John I Hattney,
constable of police.- For that you, I on thc 10th of July, in the year of Our
Lord ' 1876, after the coming into operation of the Act of Parliament of
Victoria, numbered 632, did at a lottery house, situated in Little j Bourke-
street east, Melbourne,- in said baili wick and colony, contrary to tho
provision ' of said act, and to those of the 31st section of the Police
OifenceB Statute 1865, severally I assist at the same time and place some

person, the complainant unknown, in con ducting a certain lottery by which
divers prizeB of money of an amount to the com plainant unknown were drawn for
by a certain mode of chance within the meaning of said section, and commonly
called ' Pak-a-Pu,' which said lottery, so as aforesaid described and
conducted, has been theretofore and was then established at said place by some
person to the complainant un known, nnd was then commonly called the I 'Ilan
Kie,' or 'No. 3 Bank,' and which said : lottery then was neither a
distribution of any property amongst tbo owners thereof, wilhin tbo meaning of
said section, nor a raffle within said meaning for any work purely of art, or
at a bazaar for charitable purposes, or of a private nature."" Mr Bryan
O'Loghlen, with whom was Mr C. A. Smyth, proseented on behalf of the police,
whilst the defendants were repre sented by Mr Robert Walsh, who was in
structed by Mr Gillott. Mr O'Loghlen briefly opened the case, the proceedings
being brought under the 31st section of the Police Offences Statute 1865.
There could be no doubt but that the business in which it would be proved that
the defen dants were engaged, was a lottary , and as such the defendants were
liable to punishment. It V7as for the defendants to show that their bank was
exempted from tho conditions of the Act. Detective Hartney was the first
witness examined. The officer proved having visited HnfonHani'a rtlfiP.A of
hllflinafl

Little Bourke street east, and known as No, 3 Bank, on the night of the 10th
inst. in company of Detective Coleman. Wituess, on entering thc back room,
inquired in a lond tone of voice what the number of tho bank was, and received
the . reply from the defendant that it was No. 3 Bank. Witness here described
the' mode of drawing the tickets, which has been given time after time in The
Herald in former trials, which renders it unnecessary to repeat it. The
evidence was, in fact, merely recapitu latory of that given yesterday. (jjsThe
bench inflicted a fine of £35 each with £5 costs each, in default six months'
imprisonment.
