Official guests, Messrs. Goldberg and Solomon, the comedy duo opened the first

Goldberg (Gilbert) Roy Cowen admitted to only one previous experience in an
art gallery. (""Two really. I can’t tell you about the other.”)

With friends, Abe and Becky, he was in the Louvre, examining Leon ardo da
Vinci’s Nativity.

“Vunderftil, vunderful,” said Abe.

“1 don’t like it,” replied Becky.

“Vot do you mean , you don’t like .it?”

“It shows the worst characteristics of ,‘th.e Jewish tradition. The baby
should have been: in a nursing home, the mother looks like she needs a good
meal . . ”

“They were very poor.” ""So poor they can af ford to have a portrait by
Leonardo da Vinci ?” ;

Goldberg said he could only use his hands for talking; the only brilliant
Jewish .thing he did was pick ajfon-Jewish partner,

Solcmon (Sullivan) Iain Kerr (“I’ll pay you later”) admired contributions, to
art as lasting for many

generations.

The exhibition (until June 23) features paint ings, sculpture, wall hang ings,

: Potter Col Levy believes that the true potters craft is making things for
people to use in daily life.

.. This is the . difference'

between the crafts and fine art, such as pictures and sculptures made to look
at, he said.

“That either produce ‘works of art* is that they contain something of the
.mystery of spiritual awareness, those things that man cannot explain or
understand, and try to draw man nearer to the truth of his oneness with
nature,” he said.

An exhibition of pottery by. Col Levy is., being held at Powell. Street
Gallery, 20 Powell Street, South Yarra,

December 1-21.

Levy said the pots on display are following the philosophy and technique of
the Bizen tradition. •

HISTORY

' A township in Japan gives its name to the Bizen ware.

' Firing of some large kilns us ed to fake 60 days, with another 60 days,to
cool, blit to day, the process takes only six to 12 days; as pots are smaller.

Levy said that the pots of Bizen were never glazed, but the . manufacture
process vitrifies the' pots' to form a stoneware body impervious to liquids
and even acids.

“The process' by which the pot is madeis theexpression in Bizen pottery,.”
Levy,said.

“Nothing can be hidden or camouflaged. Everything the potter does will be
revealed in the finished pot.

’ “All that is; craftmanship is revealed and as a result, the in herent
quality of the material and process' should be exposed with honesty and
truth,” he

ADELAIDE, SATURDAY.

A testimonial is being raised for presentation to Archdeacon Russell, who is
on the eve of departure for England. Wheat is rising, and"" 4s. lOd. is
offering freely. ADELAIDE, MONDAY. Mr. John Diekens, an old colonist and long
connected with the Press in South Australia, died on Saturday. A woman named
Bolton, an inmate of the Providence Reformatory, attempted to commit suicide
by taking poison yesterday. Sales of wheat are reported at 4a, lOd. ADELAIDE,
TUESDAY. An entertainment was given last night in favour of the Early Closing
Movement. Over 2,000 persons were present, and the interest manifested augurs
well for its success. About 5,000 householders have already signed a pledge
not to shop after six o'clock. A lire occurred last night, at Tuxmore Farm,
near Adelaide. A stack of 200 tons of hay was destroyed, but the farm
buildings were saved. The West Australian has been chartered at 60s. per ton
to take wheat to London. Wheat is firm at 4s. 10d., and there is a demand for
country flour at £11. ADELAIDE, WEDNESDAY. The Corporation have consented to
pay Coglin £600, to cancel his lease of the old Adelaide Racecourse. The Rev.
L. J. Mangan died this morning.

• WHITE MAN AMONG THE BLACKS.—There is still a belief in the statement that a
white man is with the blacks beyond Cooper's Creek. The Warrego correspondent
of the Pastoral Times of the 4th March, thus writes on the matter:— "" Mr. Sub-
inspector Gilmour is quite convinced of the truth of the report, and the
Queensland Government have forwarded six months' supplies to one of the
stations furthest out in thai direction, and have enjoined Mr. Gilmour to
prosecute the search while he sees the slightest probability of success. He
left the police station on the Bullo some time ago -with a party of the native
police under his command. As the 1 Government are acting very liberally, and
have given carte blanche in the matter, we may feel certain that from the
interest attached to the object of the expedition the search mil be vigorously
prosecuted. It will be probably some months before this result is known.""
CHINESE LOTTERIES.—The City Court was crowded on Monday, when the charges
against several Chinamen for being connected with a lottery in Little Bourke-
street came on fbr hearing. Amongst the spectators were a number of Chinese.
The defendants were seven in number, flve of whom were charged with being
beneficially interested in a lottery known as the Shung Lee Bank, No. 4,
Little Bourke street. The other two, Dang Sing and Ah Chak, were summoned for
the minor offence of selling lottery tickets. Inspector Rabat prosecuted on
behalf of the Grown!, and lir. Ireland, JQ.C., appeared for the defence of the
first five defendants, and Mr. Read for the other two. Mr- Sturt said that as
the Ghinese had'not had (any previous intimation that they would be

which hu iuvested in his busiuess. Ho also rented au extra store in Lonmlale-
streot from Mr. Alston. Tho whole of the £'200 was expended in the first
month. He had never told anyone that he started with a .capital of £1500. At
the time of sequestra- tiou, on the 18th May, his liabilities were £3899 7h,
9d., and his assets £2308 6s. Id. His liability to unsecured creditors was
£22G2 16s. 9d. .Prior to sequestration he called a meeting of his creditors
and laid a statement before them, which did not, however, correctly state his
liabilities by about £1050. The avorago monthly receipts in his business wero
between £500 and £600, and thu average monthly pay ments about the same. Ho
had lost £1791 in the seven months that he carried ou business, though he

worth of goods. Ho never made sufficient to make his ordinary expenses. In
January last the hank would make him no further advances ; at that time ho hud
sinco learned his deficiency was between £800 and £900. He first dishonored a
bill in February. When ho started be gave three aud four months bills for
goods which he bought. Sinco that tinio he had dishonored from seven to ten of
these bills. Ho garoaltogother about twenty of tbem. Since Jauuary, when ho
was virtually insol vent, he had purchased goods to tho amount of £2262, none
of which had been paid for. All tho debts duo to his unsecured creditors were
contracted since January. At seques tration ho bad £700 worth of goods in

knew hu was hopelessly insolvent! and ho believed Wragg knew it too. Ho gavo
Wragg £60 on tho 11th May, and tho bills wore re turned to him, and he gave
them to Midgley aud Co. as security for the money he owed them. Tho £60 lie
paid Wragg was in payment for goods. Ho did nut owe Wragg or Wragg and Son
anything. The state ment he made to his crodi'tors, that he owed them £725 4s.

There's nothing heronic about the title: Colin Uren, whose first one-man exhi
bition has opened1 at the Munster Arms Gallery likes egrets, those beauti ful,
; elegantly plumed birds which loll about the marshlands and swamps

So he paints them, in al! their slightly degenerate elegance, in all. theii
colour nuances, in flight or drinking or nibbling against ochre background! or
dark green skies.

And thus, Colin Urer produces some delightful sensitive; paintings which
somehow evoke a feeling of longing and admiratior in'the viewer. •

. So, for example, in the “ E g r e t sin Colder Swamp,"" 10, or in ""Egrets in
Green Swamps,"" 22, or for a change; in “Egret ir Blue Landscape,"" 49. Then
comesra small- bird devia tion, and we' see the charming' “Stilts on a Sunny
Morning,” 16, as well as “Stilt in. Lake,’

50.

This combination oi egrets and stilts would be quite sufficient for a good
sized' exhibition in itself

, But, -then, - Mr. - Uren produces another series; the “Ancestral and Abori
ginal” one, which, .while quite different frorh the bird - sefies: in style
and concept, is . so splendid, that, I„ for one, am' de lighted That’ it has
been included in this present show. , ..-C. * Quite exc el lent are those -. p
r p u d, w o o d e n

stodgy figures m “Ances tral 1"" (7) and'""Ancestral 3” (18) (somewhat in .the
mood of Grant Wood), and most- - colourful, sym pathetic and original is that
“Aboriginal Com munity — Alice Springs,"" 23, or the touching “Abori ginal
Children — Broken Hill,"" 31.

A most successful and pleasant first exhibition, and, we hope, the fore runner
of . many more to

come.

The symbols, in this case, are simply circles, ovals and' squares, and Jeremy
Barrett uses these simple signs with verve, understanding and imag

ination.

; No. 2, for example (none of these paintings have titles, just numbers) con
sists of a blue background, 25 black and 100 red solid circles. That’s all.

Barrett now arranges these circles in combina tions and variations in such a
manner that not one: combination equals any other and in which the final;
effect is not only pleasing, but perplexing (if yoii give yourself the time to
study it carefully).

Or, take No. 8, on the. other hand: A combina tion of leaf-shaped ovals or
oval-like leaves, is strewn across the canvas.

Yet, subtly, the centre ~ part of' these leaves . is y lightened in colour and
so achieves a spotlight-on stage effect which draws

your attention but also

gives strength and cohe- - sion to the total picture.

The whole exhibition then, excels in this kind of exercise, an exercise in

colour combinations and ;

colour spielereien which; , is most attractive for the - viewer and speaks
:well for this painter’s control and knowledge of his

medium.

together contrasts of back-'., grounds and contrasts of materials, yet, both;
of

There are his sculp tures of bronze ""and ’ terra

we have this large col- ■ lection of Persian and Caucasian rugs.

, -.While, at-first- thought, there seems to be no con nection between the

com

bines into some th ing ;

Tans Aguew Brace. Even to those who knew him not in his public capacity as the
great railway contractor, tint it is not to be wondered at that his funeral
should have attracted so many spectators as it did oa Wednesday; and the large
number of his friends who attended as silent mourners was a befittio^
testimony of their respect for the deceaseds memory. Attempt to Commit a
Rape.—A Yong and A Won were charged with attempting to commit a rape on two
little girls under ten years of age. To other Chinamen, A Hone and A Song,
w.ere charged with being accessory to the offence. The scene of it was stated
to"" have been £4 Little Bourke street east The evidence of both children was
given with great, circumstantiality. They were not^ however, agreed as to tbe
identity of the .particular prisoners who actually committed the offence, and
A Sung and A Hone were discharged, as there was no evidence

against them. The other two prisoners were remanded on bail -to- Friday next,
in order to afford the police an opportunity for further inquiry. A visit to
the place, a Chinese merchant's store, although pointed out by the two girls
as tbe scene of the offence, and somewhat unique and unmistakeable in its
internal fP' pearance and arrangements, does not assist inuch in coming to a
conclusion on the matter. The publicity of the front part of the building (a
large store) renders it at first sight incredible that so audacious an offence
should have been attempted by the inmates of it; the comparative privacy and
retirement of the bedroom, on the other hand, are perfectly consistent with
the statement of the children, that ""they cried when dragged into it, but
were-unable to make themselves heard in the street, where, in fact, they would
probably be heard by Chinamen on.y. That an offence has been committed on the
two children, there can be no doubt; but if committed by the prisoners, and in
a place so public as that indicated, it shows that some very stringent
measures must be adopted to secure tne children of ""barbarians,"" however
hurnule. from attacks so perfectly atrocKius, andso nnblushingly public, by
individuals of ""Celestial

origin.-—

• Tbe result of Easter Monday's traffic on tie Melbourne and Essenion line
will no doubt be gratifying to the company, as their revenue for some time
past has not been of too flourishing a description. Notwithstanding, however,
that a great increase in their traffic was a matter of certainty on account of
the review, no extra accommodation was provided for the sale oi tickets, and
owing to the extra demand, and tbe rush consequent thereon, the usual fere of
U 9d, unless when that amount was exactly pari? was, in many instances,
increased to 2s for wait of change.

some - with distinguished, records as commandoes and U.S. - marines

worked hard to train the men and women into military shape.

On the third night we received ashock intheform of a garbled broadcast from
Israel, instructing ns to “keep away, keep away. '. .’’ We later learned that
Begin and the Irgiin command decided to delay the departure and them the
landing because of concern witii breaking 'the cease

fire.

; But we did not receive the message sent to Paris, and we followed the
message radioed to ns directly only in part.

After much deliberation and the weighing of a num ber of alternatives, Lankin
ordered the captain to proceed full speed to as . near and safe a distance
from Israel that might enable us to re-establish communications and be ad
vised as to developments.

We continued to sail for another, eventless,, five days.

The men were improving in military performance. The' “fifth company,'” mostly
“Anglo-Saxons” war veterans, were formed into a good unit that could have
effected an initial lan ding and held a small perimeter if forced to it by

the enemy.

We had food and water reserves for about two weeks.

We intensified anti aircraft and anti-naval wat ches. Privately, I outlined
and noted highlights of possible negotiations and dialogue with U.N.
representatives, in case we would be stopped by U.N.

vessels.

On the morning of June 19, the communication silence was broken. We were 220
miles off shore. The radios worked both way. The codes functioned.

We were instructed to proceed to Kfar Vitkin.

Our joy was over whelming. Not only because we felt reassured by' Overcoming
the com munication breakdown, but also because Kfar Vitkin, a stronghold of
the “left” and the Hagana, was selec ted as the landing spot. ;

It meant the new state and army were really evolving into the national
entities they had to, to be

. able to survive.

"" By noon we were advisee that an Israeli plane woulc meet us and accompany u;
to the shore. The plane die not appear, but this did no dampen our spirits. ,

We now felt sure that the last ISO miles would be safe and the Altalena, with
it; precious human ant material cargo was home. Nevertheless the watch was

tightened and the anti aircraft crews were giver the Israeli identifying
marks, to avoid foul-ups.

As the sun settled, we ap proached the beach ant shore. We lost about sb
hours, haying gone too fa

south to Tel Aviv. Wi returned northward a about 3 a.m. and locatet

the red signals of the fishing jetty at Kfar Vitkin.

'There were no proper

boats . to’ help in the unloading. The yraves were pretty.;-higher The east'
was beginning to light up. Begin instructed Ivankin from the

shore that we should go out to sea and return in the evening.

June 20, 9 p.m., Captain Fine, formerly commander of a USN LST in the ^
Pacific! executed the text book, manoeuvre of:; drop ping his anchor, and with
line slackened, steam with ■ full power’onto the sandy beach.

LAST LAP

i The heavy gates opened,

the' small bridge lowered and Begin stepped on it

from a small beach boat. After inspection of the for mations, the disem
barkation of the men and women started. We used three small boats.

The. men and women carried a few personal belongings. No weapons, or
ammunition or their luggage. They were home. The camp survivors. The
volunteers from the Western world, and the sprinkling of non-Jews who felt
their duty to be counted at an historical moment.

Having had some am phibious experience, I stood on the small bridge and helped
control the disembarkation of • the naturally emotional and happy men and
women.

Aware of the backgroun ds and experiences of most, I swallowed-hard and kept a
business-like manner. But moments like these stay with one forever.

. Within a couple of hours,

• Twenty Japanese paintings are. being exhibited at the Caulfield Arts Centre
until

September 17. The paintings, brought to Australia; by' the Nippon Nangain
Association, comprise - the third tour of Nanga paintings outside Japan.

Halfway-; through the Edo period (1603-1898), the style was introduced into
Japan,.via block-printed instruction

albums and an influx- .of Chinese painters.

The Nanga. artists of today follow that long tradition and still paint in a
unique style. The subject matter is a blend of Japanese scenery and arr
chitecture together with the old Chinese influences of the past . ;

Oil, pastels and etchings; by Paul Delprat . are . being exhibited at the
Munster Arms Gallery until September 20.

Sydney-born .Paul Delprat has been awarded the Le Gay Brereton Prize” and

the Altalena was empty, all its men gone except for a few dozen members of the
“fifth company” who stayed for watch duty.

Then the crates of weapons and annunition started to be unloaded! Still no
sign of additional lan ding boats that, so. we were told, the ' army or the
Paimach promised. V ■

■ The unloading proceeded slowly. It became clear that it might last for many
hours. -X ?.;V-X. "".

I went back to my bunk, picked up my small duffle bag, tucked in the
beautiful""

Russian automatic that my old friend, Gershon Hakim, the quartermaster,

uncovered v amongst the. Irgun’s acquisitions in Europe, and took the laun ch
to shore, with some sealed heavy crates. •

On the beach, I held a reunion that was quite emotional.

Not only shaking Begin’s hand, whom I bad never seen except under very strict
conspiratorial . un derground conditions,. but meeting some of my old comrades
of -j fifteen years ago, from the days when I first joined the Irgun, in
1933\. Kook, Merlin, Meridor, Holcbman and others were all there.

My assignment of - the Altalena was completed. It reminded me of some of those
State Department men who went on landings with the marines — only to find out
that there was no more negotiating to do.

However, the historic chapter of the Altalena was not closed yeU;

• Part 2 next week.

Art of the

erotic

• Erotica — a stylised way of portraying the. sensual feeling we all have
about sex . Exhibition of works by Paul .Delprat, Munster Arms Gallery.

Paul Delprat stems from a very artistic family. His great- • grandfather was
Julian Ashton j sometimes called the “father of Australian art” arid the
founder of the Sydney-art school bearing his name. .■

Interested in the human form • arid especially big bosomy

fleshy nudes, the artist a protege. of Norman Lindsay who encouraged his
portrayal of “erotica” and advised him : in the technique of.pen and ink

drawing.

Delprat was therefore the ob vious choice as artist for the , film of Norman
Lindsay novel

‘•‘Age of Consent”.

•In the 1960s Delprat worked . with, other aspiring artists con

riected with the Sydney art con noisseur. Kim Bonython, and his: works i
at'this -time' com manded high prices. <

Following an-extensive over seas sojourn in the early 1970s Delprat 'retumeti
'to Australia',

.with a wealth of new ideas and . began experimenting with new

techniques, especialffcetching.1

• In 1976 an' exhibition of^his work in Sydney created a mild ' sensation when
New South Wales Premier Wran in

tervened to call off a raid^by the Vice Squad.

This exhibition includes oils} pastels and etchings, by Delprat. It closes
September

20.
