Itching Piles and Other Itching Skin  

Troubles Cure by Doan's Ointment.

About one person in every four suffers from some form of skin complaint. Skin
disease is very obstinate to cure, and there is a tendency to become chronic.
But no one need suffer, for Doan's Ointment has   been proved to cure every
teasing skin   irritation of the skin — Piles, Eczema, Hives,   Sores, Insect
Bites, Chilblains, &c.; Then   get a pot of this wonderful remedy to-day;  

it is soothing and healing, and will bring you lasting relief.  

Mrs. Nugent, 6 Little Bourke-street west, South Melbourne, says:— ""I cannot
speak   too highly of Doan's Ointment for healing   the skin and for skin
complaint. This     preparation is soothing and comforting. I have used it,
and I know its value. I have also found it excellent for eruptions of the
skin, cuts, sores, and anything else wrong with the skin. I have recommended
it to   many sufferers, and all are unanimous in declaring it the finest skin
remedy on   earth.""  

A year later Mrs. Nugent says:— ""I have   the greatest faith in Doan's
Ointment; it   cured me of an irritating skin complaint twelve months ago, and
I am still quite right."" Doan's Ointment is splendid in   all diseases of the
skin; it is perfectly safe,     and very effective. Very often two or three
pots have cured chronic cases which have resisted other remedies for years.
Doan's     Ointment is sold by all chemists and store- keepers at 2/9 per pot,
or will be posted on     receipt of price by Foster-M'Lellan Co., 76
Pitt-street, Sydney.

But be sure you get DOAN'S.—[Advt.]

With a crash of failing girders and bricks a three-storied building, owned and
occu- pied by Mr. A. H. Enticott, art engraver, at 394-6 Little Bourke street,
Melbourne, at the rear of Kirk's Bazaar, subsided on its foundations on the
afternoon of June 24, and precipitated half its eastern wall into excavations
which were being completed on the adjoining site on the corner of     Wright's
lane, for the erection of the new Hardware Club building. No one was injured,
but the damage, is estimated at £12,000, the building having been ruined.

had been heard since shortly after 2 o'clock gave warning to the employees on
the premises, numbering 18, and all escaped. Workmen in the excavations next
door also escaped just in time, after having removed six drays and horses. The
cause of the accident is attributed to the ""greasy"" nature of the ground about
the foundations. To what extent the ad- joining excavations contributed will
be in- quired into by the city engineer (Mr. H. E. Morton). An extraordinary
sequel to the collapse of the building was an attempt, in the dusk, under Mr.
Morton's direction, to wreck the remainder by a fire-hose, be- cause the
tottering walls were dangerous. The pressure of water, however, only loos-
ened sections of the wall, as the girders in falling had locked on a dividing
interior wall. An effort will be made to blast away the obstruction. The
wrecked building was constructed in brick in 1902. It adjoined the old
Governor Arthur Hotel, which was delicensed in 1918. The old hotel had been
converted into offices and a factory, but it has now been almost demolished to
provide a site for the new seven-storied reinforced concrete building of the
Hard- ware Club.
