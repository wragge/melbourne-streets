SroLEN PaIorcarrr.-- Bartho lomew iM'Carthy was brought up on remand I to
receivo osentence for stealing money from tile till of Mr. Hellett's shop,
arnd to answer a i chalrgo of Ihaviig a stolen watchl, seals, and I key in his
possession. Mr. Walker defended 1 the prisoner. Thomas Trood, manager of the
Victoria 1 Boot Factory, Spring-street, Melbourne, de posed-On Tuesday, 20th
Jiuno last, I lost ai gold watch. I saw it at eight o'clock on the morning of
that day, and it was then in the hands of my child, in bed. I missed it at a
quarter to one o'clock on the same day, and I next saw it in tile hands of'the
police, about the 27th ult. I identify the watch, seals, and key produced as
my property. A gold chain was attached to the watch when I lost it. It
belonged to my wife. I identify it by its general appearac: eo and the number.
The watch was left in the bedroom. I never saw the prisoner before to my
knowledge. Ilost the gold brooch produced at the same timen. The value of the
watch is £13, the brooch cost £6 10s., and the seals and key aroeworth about
£1. Mrs. Trood, the wife of the last witness, identified the brooch, and
stated that sihe never sold or disposed of them to any person. Constable
Richard Hamilton deposed-On Monday, the 20th June, at two o'clock p.m., I
arrested the prisoner at Hawthorn. On searching him I found upon him the
watch, seals, and key produced in his coat pocket. I took the watch to Mr.
Trood, and he iden tified it as his property.... Abraham Harris, a pawnbroker,
residing at No. 3, Little Bourke-street west deposed -The brooch produced was
pawned with me on the 22nd June, by the prisoner. I fully identify him'as the
person who pawned it. He gave the name of John Sullivan. The brooch was pawned
for 10s.,, and its value is about 80s. The Bench sensured the conduct of the
pawnbroker in advancing money to a lad like the prisoner. The witness replied
that but for him the brooch would have been lost; for he gave in formation to
the detective office before the article appeared in the list. Thie boy was 18
years of age, and was respectable in his dress at that time. iHe was sorry the
Bench should have thought proper to make such a remark. The Bench believed
that were it not for such establishments as the last witness'e, there would be
lbwer robberies committed. Mr. Walker addressed the Bench for the deflence.
fie c untauded theret=rss0no proof that the prisoner stole the watch. The
Bench intimated that! there was evi dence to show that lie had it in his
possession, and that he pawned the brooch. - The prisoner was also charged

warehouse, in Flinders lane; and Detective Foster: applied for a re mand to
the City Court on this charge, four other youths who had absconded from the

being con cerned in the same robbery. The Bench sentenced tile prisoner to
three months' imprisonment with hard labour for robbing the till at Mr.
Bellett's shop, com mitted him for trial on the charge of, having a stolen

they were worth £5. The plaintiff said he should have them for that price if

THE new railways offices in Spencer-street have been • recently enhanced in
appearance by the erection of an allegorical group of figures over the fagade.
The ornamentation has a very pretty effect. The building is now almost
completed fixternally, but it will be'some, months before-it 1b furnished and
ready for occupation. AT A special meeting of the Executive Council, held on
Saturday evening, a board was appointed to ; investigate the charges brought
against Lt.-Colonel Priee, of the .Mounted Rifles. The board includes Major-
General Keogh, an . Imperial officer here on furlough, Commander Hay, -and Mr.
Nicolson, P.M. . Tas revenue of the Railway department ior the past fifteen
weeks of the financial year, which began on the 1st July last, shows a
handsome increase as compared with the same period of the preceding year. The
receipts this year amount to £834,917, ""while for the same period of the
previous year they were £785,961, the increase thus .being £48,956. The
commissioners estimate sthat .their revenue this year will be £150,000 more
than it was last year.

THE Royal ComrhiBBionon Charities visited several night shelters on Monday
evening. At St. Vincent de Paul's Home, in St. Davidstreet, Fitzroy, the
premises were remarkably clean and cheerful, but the atmosphere was close,
resulting from the casuals' antipathy to water. PBOBATE has been granted of
the wills of the following:—William Brown, £4780; William Barnicott, £3068;
Sarah Anne Beatty, £814; Charlotte Lavinia Dean, £850; John Charles Foller,

Tas Railway Commissioners have accepted the following tenders:—Erection of
sheep and cattle yards at Tottington, Reid and Bayles, £307 16s. 6d.; erection

Railway Commissioners on Monday acoepted the tender of Messrs. R. Campbell and
Co., at £4881 16B. 6d., for the erection of a platform and verandah at the
Prince's Bridge railway station. This work will form a portion of the
comprehensive scheme of improvements which the commissioners have decided to
carry out at both that and the FlinderB-street station, and which will be of a
permanent character. THE Railway Commissioners were sued on Monday in the
Supreme Court, before Mr. Justice Hood and juries of six, by T. H. Nolan, of
Mornington, wine and spirit merchant. He sued for £1000 on account of having
broken his leg at Moorooduc, on the night of the 17th April. He said that the
train overshot the platform, and that he got out beyond it, thinking the train
was at the platform. The defence was that the train drew up at the platform,
and that the plaintiff did not try to get out till the train had again started
and had got beyond the platform. The jury found a verdict for the defendants.

THE Centennial Exhibition Commissioners brought their labours to a close on
Monday afternoon, when their final meeting was held in the Town Hall. The
receipts from all sources amounted to £100^241 16s., which, deducted from
£338,026 10s. 8d., the total expenditure incurred, left £237,784 14s. 8d. as
the coBt to the Government of holding the Exhibition. A report of the work of
the commissioners for presentation to the Governor was passed, and will be
presented together with a copy of the Official Record, when the latter is
published. .. Mas. MUNBO, a widow, residing in George street, Box Hill, on

assertion that they intend to aek for the re-introduction of the old system of
closing the public officeB at four o'clock. THE chief inspector of stock has
received reports indicating the prevalence of pleuropneumonia among the cattle
in the green grass districts. He is not surprised at the information, for with
the early summer rains the cattle have got into the condition when they are
peculiarly liable to attacks of this disease. Every precaution is being taken'
to prevent diseased meat from finding its my to the market. There is little or
no danger of the milk supply being affected.

THE premier has received a cable message rom Lord Knutsford, Secretary of
State lor the Colonies, intimating that Captain A W. Moore, a post captain in
the Roya'I Navy, has been selected to represent the Admiralty at the naval and
military conference to be held in Melbourne in connection with the defence of
King George's Sound and Thursday Island. A PECULIAB case was heard at the
District Court on Monday, when Mr. John E. Mitchell appeared to answer a
charge of being wilfully guilty of not allowing another person to pass on the
right or-ofi side. The accused is a well-known advertising agent, and when in
Swanston-Btreet, on the 4th inst., he blocked the Governor's. carriage. The
accused, in reply to the bench, said he ""was not a 'British subject. He waB an
American Mr. Panton then read him a lecture, and stated his common sense
should have told him it was right to make room for the Governor's carriage.
The defendant was fined £3. THK Countess of Hopetoun left Melbourne by the

continues to increase rapidly. During the last three months (the first quarter
of the financial mar) 22,948 parcels were despatched from L General Post
Office, and 17,536 received, shoving a total of 40,484. During the
corresponding period of last year the total numher received and despatched was
35,224, so that the increase during the last three months was 5260. A no?
named Ernest Harbordt, aged fourteen, living at Irving-road, Lower Hawthorn,
was admitted into the Melbourne Hospital on Tuesday evening in an insensible
condition, and a strange story was told concerning him. It was said that
whilst he was riding in a train between Hawthorn and Burnley, with his head
out of the window, a bottle was thrown at him by some unknown person; that he
waB knocked insensible, and that when the train pulled up at Burnley he me
found in that condition, and conveyed to the hospital at once. The other
passenger in the same carriage did not appear to know vbere the bottle came
from.

AN idea of the extent to which the Yarra and Saltwater Rivers are polluted may
be judged from the fact that into those streams flows the drainage from
thirty-eight slaughter bonBes, fellmongeries, tanneries, candle and soap,
tallow, glue and manure works, boilingdown establishments, piggeries, and
chemical factories. A BET0BN was laid on the table of the Legislative Assembly
on Tuesday showing the number of warders in the Melbourne Gaol and the various
duties performed by them. There are twenty-eight warders, whose average day's
work ranges from eight to nine hours. The return also shows that whilst nine
hours is an ordinary day's work at the Pentridge and Ballarat penal
establishments, at Geelong it is as low as six hours. MB6. ADELAIDE BOBINSON,
the widow of the Iftte J. C, Bobinson, on Tuesday sued Alexander Crombie for
loss through the death of her husband, which was caused on the 19th March,
1890, by Crombie. The two bad a dispute, and the deceased rushed at Crombie,
when the latter put up his umbrella, which, striking Robinson's eye, fractured
his Bkull and caused his death. Crombie was tried for manslaughter, but
acquitted. The defence was that it was an accident, or done in self-defence.
The ca6e was tried before Mr. Justice Hood and a jury of six. A verdict was
given for £400 in all, being £250 for the widow, and £150 for the child.

A LARGE increase has taken place in the revenue of the Railway department
since the end of the financial year, notwithstanding the depression existing
in consequence of the labour dispute. It is still more surprising that during
the same period an enormous increase has taken place in the deposits made in
the Post Office Savings Bank, whilst the withdrawals have decreased. Not only
has this been noticeable during the present financial year, but ever since the
end of April. With the exception of two weeks during the whole of this period,
every week has Bhown an increase of deposits over withdrawals. The amount to
the credit of depositors on Tuesday was £1,895,034 17s., as against £1,719,312
7s. at the end of April, so that the inorease since that date is £175,722 10s.
The authorities are of opinion that the falling off in the proportion of
withdrawals is due to the fact that depositors are refraining from investing
or expending more than is absolutely neoessary during the unsettled times.

THE curator of the estates of deceased persons has obtained rules to
administer the estates of the following deceased persons, wider the Act No.

the name of a well-known resident to a guarantee bond, said to be for an
amount of £500. The circumstances of the case have not yet been fully
explained, but it is understood that the discovery of the alleged forgery was
made by the travelling inspector of the National Bank upon a recent visit to
the branoh of the bank at the place named. THE sums paid during the past ten
years to shires as special subsidy of £3 for every £1 locally raised are shown
in a return which was laid on the table of the Lesislative Assembly on

Both Houses of Parliament will meet to morrow. In the . Legislative Assembly
several questions of minor importance will bo put to Ministers, after which
tlie debate on tho second reading ot tho Local Government Act Amend ment Bill
will be resumed. If the motion for tlie .second reading bo agreed to tlie
quostion will arise whether or not the bill should bo remitted to tho
consideration"" of a select com mittee of tho House. The proposal is likely to
give rise to a long discus sion, many members being of opinion that tho House
lis a body, and not a seleot commit tee, should sottlo tlie bow basis on which
tlie municipal endowment is to be allocated. In the Legislative Council ""tlifi
attention of1 members will be directed to the 'further consideration- in
committeo of the Metropolitan Board of AVorks Bill, aiso tho Melbourne Harbor
Trust Amend ment Bill, which has readied the samo stage. The Trade Marks Act
Amendment Bill is set doivn for report, and tho Marriago Act Amend ment Bill
tor tho third rending, after which on the notice paper comes tlie adjourned
debate on the sooond reading of the Municipnl Ovordraft Indemnity Bill. Tho
interest in the labor difficulty centres in the conference to be hold this
morning between the ship owners and tho marine officers. It is understood that
tlie ship owners are likely to receive the deputation in a conciliatory
spirit; that the question of alfiliaton with the"" Trades Hall, whicll is
stated as ono of the main points in tho Sydney manifesto, will not be raised;
nnd that as many of tho officers as possible will bo . reinstated in their
former positions, with, it - is understood, some concession from the employers
in. the matter of pay. On the other hand,' the officers declare that they will
accept no terms which are not satisfactory to tho seamen and the wharf
laborers. In any case, tho result of this first direct meeting between tlie
contending parties will bo watched with keen interest, and must of necessity
havo the most important influence on the whole labor question. There are
already ample signs that the present state of suspense is becoming unbearable,
and in Adelaide tlie marine engineers, a body who have so far pre- served a
position of strict neutrality, are threaten ing to jo in the strike' unless
tlie employers con sent to a conference. This resolution has been for warded
to the head bodj"" in Sydney for-approvai, and will doubtless be held over
until the result of this morning's conference is known. Tlie Admiral on the
Australian station, Lord Charles Scott, in a communication to tho com mandant
of tho Victorian naval forces, states that he has experienced the utmost
difficulty in obtaining a' supply of coal from Newcastle for liis war vessels.
Indeed, tlie reserve stock lias fallen so low that Lord Cliarles Scott lias
felt com-, pellcd to send to England for a supply. In tliis connection it may
be mentioned that the com mander of the three German men-of-war at present in
Sydney Harbor, though anxious to depart, is unable to do so as iie cannot
obtain coaL He endeavored to do so at Newcastle and failed, and was not any
more successful in Queensland. As a Inst resource lie is endeavor ing to
obtain a supply from New Zealand. The steamship Alberta, chartered to bring
coal for the Victorian railways from Japan, is expected to onter the bay to-
day or, at latest, to-morrow. The vessel has . been somowlmt delayed through
having to. proceed to Hong

Kong, after leaving Nagasaki cn route for Australia Sue brings 4000 toiiH of
coal, less the amount consumed on tho voyage. Messrs. Dnlguty nud Co. Limitud,
thu agents for thu vessel, have givou the llnilway ' Cominisaionova notice
that tlioy expeot to he aiilo to delivorsomo of the coal by Tnosday-or, nt
latest, on AVcdncsday. Tho vossel was telegraphed as having arrived at
Thursday Island some days ago. Two otiier largo cargoes aro also on the way to
Molbourno from Jnpnn, tlie first of which is convoyed in tho stenmor Lord of
Bangor. All tliis coal was ordered from Loudon in rosponso to a cnblo mossngc
sent to tiio English owners of the vossois. The Alberta, being a largo ship,
will nnohor off AVillinmstown. There has been a slight decrease in tho body of
correspondence carried by the postal authorl tics during tho strike, but tho
falling off has not boon nearly so great as might havo beon oxpoctcd. Strange
to say tlie cxeesB of deposits over withdrawals in tho Post Ofiico Snvlngs
Bank lias actually increased, and the railway reronuo shows like ndvanocment.
In tho par- eels /branoh of the General Post Oillco, tlie volume of business
done during tho quarter endod September likewise exhibits an oxcess of 5260
parqels carried compared with, the pre ceding quarter. The parcels, post is
becoming increasingly popular amongst business people for sending valuable
consignments of goods to up-country purohasers. Tlie Minister of Mines has
directed that a thorough inquiry bo mado into the complica tions that havo
arisen in conscqucnoe of the dictum of tho Crown law officers that tlie Mining
department lias no power to issue a mining lease over lands held for grazing
or pas toral purposes unless tlie land he resumed nnd tho liecnsoe
compensated. For a considerable time past tho Mining department has offered no
objection to tho issue of pastoral licences over land believed to be
auriferous, as it was boliovcd tlmt, if necessary, mining lenses conld he
issued over thoso lands. The announcement .that this cannot ho legally done
has oausod consternation nmongst thoso mining companies and private
individuals who have, on the fnitli of their leases, expended largo sums of
money in carrying on mining operations on land which is held also for grazing
or pastoral purposes. In this conncotion tlie question has also been raised
whether a person holding a minor's right, nnd iu possession of a lease of land
held also for grazing or pastoral occupation, can enter npon his own lease
ntid mine for ooal or any of tho metal"" - Tlie officers of tho Mining
department will compilo a list of thoso who have boon granted mining leases
undor tlie conditions abovo stated, as well as of similar applications new
pending. A report will bo prepared, showing the direction in whioli tlie law
sliould he ameuded so as . to remove .all restrictions upon mining enterprise.
. A largo number of applications have been made to the Commissioner of Public
AVorks by municipal bodies for monetary assistance to enable them to ropair
roads and bridges alleged to have been ' damaged by the floods which took
place in July last. The majority of tho applications nro from tho Gippslnnd
district and amount altogothor to £10,000. Sir. Anderson intends bringing
thorn under tlie notice of his colleagues at a mooting of tho Cabinet. to-day.
In view of tho implied promise given by tlie Treasurer in tho Legislative
Assem bly last week that claims for assistance in tho ease of flood damages
would he considered npart from the municipal subsidy, the demands will
probably meet with friendly consideration, and in urgont cases some assistance
will bo granted. The Commissioner of Public AVorks lias had under
consideration tlie request of Messrs. Brookes, Currie arid Co., proprietors of
a paper mill on tlie south bank of tlie Yaira, tlmt as compensation for the
deterioration of the Yarra water owing to the removal of the "" falls"" rocks
the Government should supply them free of cost with 1000 gallons of water per
minute for every working day from the supply brought by the Government from
Diglit's Palls for irrigating the Botanical Gardens. Mr. Anderson, after
consulting with the officers of his department, has decided thnt in no
ciroumstances enn such a. large quantity of tho Dight'a Falls supply be
spared. Ho is prepared to allow the firm a smaller quantity, hut it will have
to bo paid for. Tho . position of tho mill ronders it impossible to construct
the main road along the south bank of the river near- Princcs-hridgc, and the
Inspector-general of Public AVorks, Mr. Davidson, is now nogoti- nting with
the proprietors in tho hope of being able to sbdiire the tdiiiovnl of n
portion of tho establishment. It is proposed by tho Railway Commissioners to
havo 30 cool trucks constructed in readiness for tlie ensuing summer, to carry
perishables of all kinds ; more particularly dairy produce. The first of these
lms beon completed. It is a long vehicle, heavily constructed, and running on
bogie wheels. Between tho body of tlie interior and tho roof arrangements aro
made wherohy slabs of ice of tho total weight of 30 cwt. may he held in
suspension to keep down tlie tempera ture to a point not exoceding 45 degrees
fakrenhoit. Tho sample truck, which was designed after a pattorn oar whicll
lias boon successfully running in the United States, has received approval,
and the other 29 will be hurried to completion. On Saturday night the final
alterations were mado at tho eastern entrance to Flinders- street station, to
admit of tho Brighton train service being run in nnd out south of its former
running track! The up track had been rolnid a week previously, and the
operations under notice consisted in transferring tho down traolcfrom its old
location further towards tho rivor. Everything was completed prior to the
commencement of the Sunday running, and tho ground south ofthe Princes-bridge
station for a width of 50 feet is now loft vacant for tiio construction of a
new platform. The contract for this work is already let. AVith regard to the
threat of tliq'Footscray borough council to proceed, against the Eduea- tion
department for permitting tho Yarraville ""West Stato school to lapse into its
present dis graceful insanitary condition, the Minister for Public Instruction
explains thnt immediately tho matter was brought under the notice of tho
department hy an inspector sent down specially to ascertain tlie reason why
tho local board of advice desired the removal of the head teacher, the latter
was suspended, and another one put in Charge with instruction"" to have the
school grounds nnd outbuildings thoroughly oloauBed. Dr. l'earsqn states tlmt
tho department acted promptly direotly its attention was called to tlie
existing stato of affairs, and adds that a remedy would have beon applied
earlier, but that the department was kept in ignorance of the case owing to nn
estrangement having taken place between tho hoard of advice and tho Public Ser
vice Board in conncotion with the removal of a truant officer.' Tho Spring
mooting of the Victoria Amateur Turf Club was hi ought to a close at Caulfield
ou Saturday under most satisfactory circum stances, the weather boing
favorable, and the racing, which was of an exceptionally interest- ng
ohnraoter, wns witnessed by a very large iassomblago of spectators, including
his Excel lency tho Governor and a party from Govern ment House. The first
event on tho card, tho Maidon Plate, was won easily hy Acusliio, followed by
Nihilist and Peggy. Mr. Samuel Gardiner's filly, Submission, won the Nursery
Handicap, with Harrington second, nud Ascot Vale third, nnd in the Selling
Race tho places wore filled by Donoaster, The Bud and Past- master. Twenty-
four of tlie 31 lioraes.colored on tho card started for the Caulfield Cup,
which excited very, keen interest. For Borne weeks past a considerable amount
of wagering was carried on concerning the raoc. At tho start Both well and
Pygmalion wore nearly equal favoriteB, but a number of others were well
supported. The winner turned up in Mr. A. R. Blackwood's liorso Vengeance, a
5-year- old son of Nowminstor and Vindex, carrying 6 st. 13 lb., trained by A.
Taylor, of Eallnrat, and ridden by the well known steeplechase jockey, r.
M'Gownn. A'ongeaneo had previously been hut a poor performer, and on liis last
appear- nnce iu public on the same course, last August, he out an inglorious
figure in the Victorian Club Handicap. It wns evident, however, thnt somebody
considered liirn to he capable of improving on that display, as lie camo
prominently into tlie betting market on AV ednesdny evening, and was hacked to
win a good stake. A great raco from t'ne distance post resulted in a victory
for Vengeance hy a short head from Loyal Stone, who wns followed home hy Enuo.
Tnrooola ran fourth and Both- woll .fifth, but Pygmalion novcr onoo showed
prominently aftor the flag foil. Tho timo, 2 mm. 38 see., is the best
evorreeorded for the Caul field Cup since tho distance was increased to a mils

and a half, being half a acaond faster than Oliiongon previous record fn 1888.
Tiio Steoplo- olinso resulted in nil equally oxoiting finish, Acrobat, ridden
hy Corrigan, heating Prosper hy a head, with Vulturo a inodernto third. A most
interesting afternoon's racing terminated witli the AVimlsor Handicap, which
wns contested hy 27 starters, Mr. J. Kudfenrn scoring a popu lar wiu with
Nowton, who easily defeated tho favoritos, Invostigator nnd Elsio. Aftor the
horses had passed tho post in the rnoo for tlie Caulfield Cup Plenty fell nnd
Onkloigh stumbled over liim, tlie lattor'n rider being carried off tlie
course, hut fortunately lie was not sorioualy injured. In tho Steoplochnso
Sntnn camo down in front of tho stand, and his rider, Davis, sustained a
slight oonoussion ot tho brain, theso being the only mislmps which occurred
during tlie afternoon. As usual on tho Caulfield course, tho arrangements were
complete in every particular, and visitors were carried back to town
expeditiously by spcoial trains, which wore despatched in rapid suc cession.
Spite of the unsettled stato of tlie weather a large number of persons took
ndvnntnge of the first trip this season of tho bay excursion steamer Ozone, on
Saturday, and yesterday also tlie boat wns woll filled. Tho Ozone is in
oxcellont trim, and .her performances gave every satisfaction! A mixture of
Newcastle and- foreign coal is being used. Quoenscliff and Sorrento ore al

..rails has been laid down for tho tramway at tlie latter favorite seasido
resort, nnd the cars are to com- mouoo running in a fortnight. Many improve

erection of a roomy refreshment saloon. A largo building for the ncoommodnrion
of visitors hns likewise been put up on private property near the park gatca,
and is shortly to bo opened under the designation of the Back Benali Palnco.
At the Continental Hotel, on tho bay side, n stone annex has beon crceted for

in tho town hall. Several members of the Ministry have been invited to be
present. In tho evening the prinoipal business houses will bo illuminated, and
a firemen's torchlight procession is beikg organised. The case of Mr. Aligns
Cumining, sub-account ant nt tlie General Post Office, ""whom the Publio
Service Board proposes to supersede in a mnnuer which is held to be an
extremely arbitrary exoroise of power, is receiving sympathetic opn-
sidoratiou from other officers in tho department. A fund lias .been
established to assist in liqui dating Mr.. Oumming's expenses should he
persist in his determination to seek redress at law. ' Tlie case of a butcher
nt Eeliuca named -Mulling, who pleaded guilty of smuggling 98 head of oattle
across tho Murray into Victoria with the design of ovading the stock tax, was

Tipping, occupied tlie chnir. The report of tho secretary, Mr. H. 0. Rhys- J
ones, reviewed at considerable length the operations of tho association for
tho pnst 12 months, and indicated a -marked degree of success as the result of
the efforts of tlie executive body to foster a-feeling of friendship and unity
amongst the metropolitan and provin: cinl reporters. Tho report also
congratulated the Association on the advance 'made towards, bringing about n
federation of the . association . in - all-' tho colonies. In moving

A special meeting of the Executive Coun cil will bo held on Monday next, for
the purpose of taking into consideration tho death sentence unused bv his
Honor Judge

Williams on the negro Oscar Wallace for the Mount Beekwortli outrage. It will
be seen from our Knglisli telegram that Asiatic cholera lias found its way to
Loudon, nnd lias manifested itself in tlio east portion of that city. The
Assembly Chamber last evening pre sented a somewhat disorderly appearance, and
strongly brought to minil some of the disturbances in the ullen days. Mr.
Harker, not being satisfied with the answer given to Mr. Mac Bam by Mr.
Francis respecting the Cape route, moved tho adjournment of the House for
tliepurposeof making aspeecli. Tho Speaker rulcdhim outof order, and tlio
debate became so warm that Mr. W. Clarice called the attention of the Speaker
to tho fact of strangers being in tho gallery, and for the first time (luring
the present session of Par liament there was a general clearance made. This
was only about ten minutes previous to the House adjourning for refreshment.
When the House resinned all traces of the previous unpleasantness had passed
away, and Mr. Harker was allowed to proceed. Barber in tho discussion one of
tho members for .South Grant, Mr. Levien, politely ex- pressed his opinion
that "" all the row had been caused by the extremely partial ruling of tho
Speaker."" Upon this there was a general cry of "" Bhame "" and ""withdraw."" Air.
Gillies at once took action in the matter, and moved that the words be taken
down. Mr. Levien promptly withdrew his expres sion, with the announcement that
he was not aware it was unparliamentary. A desultory discussion on the
advantages and disadvantages of a subsidised line of steamers between
Melbourne atul England via the Cape occupied the greater part of the sitting
of the Legislative Assembly last evening. The debate was brought on in a very
irregular manner by Mr. Harker, and arose out of a question put 'by Mr.
MaeBain with a view of eliciting from tho Govern ment whether they would take
imme diate steps to encourage tho establish ment of monthly steam
communication by that route. Mr. Francis explained that he was at present in
communication with Mr. Vogel relative to a New Zealand mail service to
alternate with that via Suez, and until that correspondence was completed the
Government would not be in a position to fully consider tho proposition
brought forward by tho hon. member. This answer was accepted by Mr. MaeBain,
hut, to tho surprise of all, Mr. Harker rose to move the ailjourment of the
House, with a view of having the whole question fully discussed. After a very
heated dis cussion as to tho right of lion, meinl-crs to move such a
resolution, Mr. Harker was allowed to proceed, and in a lengthy speech
strongly deprecated any subsidy being granted to a line of steamers via the
Cape, which he looked upon merely as a system of assisted immigration. From
this'stnrtiug point hon. members had a full opportunity of ex pressing their
different opinions on the subject, and the majority of them availed themselves
of tho occasion. Mr. Francis replied to tho stotement made by Mr. Harker, and
explained that some time since negotiations wero commenced with tho Victorian
Government by Messrs. Blight Brothers and C'o. for the es tablishment of a
monthly service via the Cape for £80,000 per annum, or of a four weekly
service for £39, 500. Unfortunately the matter had fallen through owing to
some opposition in England, but lie considered the Government would only he
doing their duty in accepting such an offer if it was made, even if they had
not an opportunity of first submitting it to l'arliament. After several hours
had been wasted in discussing the sub ject without anything definite being
arrived at, the motion for adjournment was put and lost, and tho House
proceeded to tho next business. There is some probability of the Pleasant
Creek jumps being still further complicated, as tlio Cabinet have now under
consideration tlio desirability of issuing the lease for No. 4 Scotchman's
Reef, which wus refused at the time the other leases wero issued. It has been
pointed out that the shareholders have been paying a largo amount of calls,
aud they are there fore entitled to the lease. The matter has not yet been
decided, but ns the present state of affairs lias evoked a somewhat strong
expression of public opinion nt Stawell, and some people are afraid that n
breach of the peace will take place when any action is taken by till? warden
to put the junipers in possession, the Government have deemed it advisablo to
take tho necessary steps for the preservation of the peace by sending up a
detachment of police. It will bo seen by a telegram in another column that
twenty-five constables arrived at Ballarat yesterday rii route for Stawell.
Itis stated that in issuing tho invitations for the Birthday Ball on Wednesday
evening some members of Parliament were overlooked,

nml they aro consequently wroth. That there is some foundation for the rumor
ap pears probable from a notice of motion given in the Assembly last evening
by Mr. Woods. He intends to move for a return of the cost of the preparation
of the Museum buildings for the hall, together with an esti mate of the
probable cost of tho restoration of the exhibits to their former places.
Considerable discontent is shown by the four banks who do not get from the
Govern ment a share of the public accounts, and the Treasurer was last evening
asked by Mr. It. M. Smith how long the present arrangements, whereby the
business is left in the hands of the six con tracting banks, would he
continued. Mr. Langton explained that at the time the loan for the
construction of the North-eastern Railway was floated Sir James M'Cnlloch
agreed that those hanks, should have the public accounts until that line was
com pleted. As soon as that work was finished the Government would be able to
make any fresh arrangement they might consider de sirable. IfMr. M'Kenzie, the
coal-viewer of New South Wales, is required to investigate and report upon
every discovery of coal that is

being made in Victoria, his visit to this colony is likely to be indefinitely
prolonged. Last night, in the Legislative Assembly, Mr. Mason informed tbe
Minister of Mines that coal had been found at or near the head waters of tlio
Long Lang River, and near Bear Greek, Gipps Liftul, about three miles from the
proposed lino of railway. Four areas of one square mile each have been applied
for under search lieenees. The seam where it crops up on tho surface is said
to be ten inches in thickness, attaining, at tho depth of three feet, a
thickness of eighteen inches. Mr. Mason's object in conveying this information
to the Minister of Alines was to ask him if lie would prooure from Mr.
M'Kenzie a roport on the subject. Air. Afaokay replied that if the lion,
member would furnish the Government with full par ticulars, an officer of the
department would, should the matter be considered of sufficient importance, be
sent down to report. Mr. Al'Ivenzie yesterday commenced liis tour of
inspection of the probable coal fields in the neighborhood of Geolong. The
Education department having decided to open a new Stntc school in tho stoehade
at Carlton, it is considered that the school No. 1073, which lias been
presided over by Air. Knox for some years past, would bo ueriouslyaffectetl. A
deputation on the sub-

ject was therefore introduced yesterday to the Aiinister of Education bj' Air.
Burtt, AI.L.A., with a view of calling his attciition to tho fact. Tho
following minute of rii interview with Mr. \ enables, on ff'Jnd July, on the
subject, was read : ""Mr. Vonablcs distinctly stated that Mr. George Knox, as
head teacher of Stato school No. 1073, had first right and claim to whatever
school became tho permanent Stato school of Victoria ward ; and further, that
gentleman stated the Education department held laud in the vicinity of North
Fitzroy, and should it eventually ho proven that tho buildings known as tho
stockade were the best suited, and in tlio best position for the purposes of a
permanent Stato school for Victoria ward, tho site and buildings now held by
school No. 1073 should be sold, Air. Knox made head master of tho school in
tho stockade, and Mr. Jones removed to tho mastership of such schools as
should bo erected on tho reserved land in or about North Fitzroy, above
mentioned, or Buch other post as tho department should think fit ; but
whatever steps should hereafter be taken, Air. Knox's prior rights and claims
in the aboveiiiontioneil ward would he strictly conserved by the department.""
Air. Stephen Eromiscd that the terms of the minute should e observed, nnd that
buildings should nt once be erected for a State school which would accommodate
S00 or 1000 children. A great deal of interest was evinced in tho sale by
auction yesterday, by Alcssrs. G. J. ami T. Ham, of tho proporty in Flinders-
street and Flindcrs-huie known as De- gravos' mill. The property consists of a
block of ground, about an acre in extent, having a frontage of 132 feet to
each of the thoroughfares named, on which is erected Degrnvca' flour mill and
stores, and tho largo free stores fronting Flinders-street, now in the
occuxiation of Afessrs. Pearson and Co. Tho land and buildings were subject to
a mortgage of £30,000 to James Tyson, due 5th August, 1S72, nnd by
instructions they were yesterday sold iu one lot. Tho first bid made was
£30,000, which was slowly increased by bids of £1000 until £3S,000 was
reached. Bids of £500 were then given until £42,000 wan offered ; an
additional £250 was then bid by Mr. Alonckton Synnot, nnd after some delay the
property was knocked down to that gentleman for the sum of £42,250. Tho
Carlton school board imhror/lio is not -yet nt an end. It appears that at the
second election for the members of the school board of advice a somewhat
similar mistake occurred as at tho previous election. Tho matter is to be
brought under the notice of the Aiinister of Public Instruction on Tuesday
next by Mr. Fergusson, and it will bo then seen what notion will be taken. In
tbe present cose it appears that the name of ono of tlio candidates, Jenkin
Henry, by some mistake, was transposed on the bal lot paper so as to read
Henry 'Jenkin. It is contended tliat this transposition would necessarily lose
him a number of votes, as his friends would not recognise his name on tlio
ballot paper. In another .coluir will be found a protest from Air. Kennedy,
ono of tho defeated candidates. , A meeting of Mr. Wm. Morley's friends was
hold at Sefton's Brunswick Hotel, Bay- street, Sandridge, on Wednesday Last.
Tho object of the meeting was to request Mr. Morley to abandon his understood
intention of resigning his position in the borough council. Mr. Todd was
called to the chair. The chairman opened the proceedings by alluding to the
long acquaintance which he and most of those present had had with Mr. Morley,
especially dwelling on the ex emplary character, social and public, of Mr.
Morley and his family during the past eighteen or twenty years that they liad
resided in (Sandridge. A requisition, signed by over GllO of the ratepayers
and inhabi tants of the borough, was presented by Ah. Alinton, who introduced
tho subject by some appropriate remarks. Alessrs. .Swallow and Greskam also
addressed the meoting. The observations of the various speakers went to bIiow
that the prosecutions to which Air. Alorley had been subjected arose moro from
personal animosity than from a desire to promote or vindicate public virtue.
At the meeting of the Gardiner Shire Council, on Wednesday, 30th July, after
the transaction of routine business, the pre sident (Mr. J. Munro) gave notice
of the fol lowing motion for discussion at the next council meeting : ""That on
and after the 1st day of September, 1873, every person employed by the shire
council of Gardiner, where the custom is to work by the day, shall be deemed
to liavo done a day's work if ho has worked during any lawful day for a period
of eight hours at any occupation or employment for or under the said shire
council."" Mr. Munro informed the council that his object was to enable the
ratepayers at the coming, election to send in representa tives who arc cither
for or against tho reso lution, ns he considered this courso prefer able to
that of taking a ballot of tho rate payers on this question only. As a large
amount of interest is taken at present in the eight hours' movement, immediate
action will bo taken by the ratepayers of the shire. At Boroondara a
resolution somewhat simi lar to the above was carried by a large ma jority of
votes, a poll of the ratepayers having been taken to test the question. A
meeting of gentlemen interested in microscopical investigations was Held last
night, at the Hall of the Royal Society; Mr. R. J. Ellery in the chair. The
meeting had been convened by Dr. Robertson, who briefly explained that he had
taken that step as he thought it desirable that Mel- bourne should no longer
remain without a microscopical society. He had therefore consulted with
several gentlemen, and issued a number of invitations, to which those pre sent
had responded. There was a free and interesting discussion as to a former
society, and the reasons why it became defunct ; also in reference to the
qualifications for membership in the proposed Society, and the regulations
under which it should be governed. It was decided, on the motion of Dr.
Robertson, seconded by Dr. Ralph, ""That it is de sirable, in the opinion of
this meeting, to form a Microscopical Society of Victoria."" On the motion of
Mr. Sydney Gibbons, seconded by Mr. Archer, it was then re solved to form such
a society, to contain members who were qualified workers with the instrument
and associates who had evinced a desire to work. .A Iong conversa tion then
ensued upon the qualification for the members of committee, and on the mo tion
of Mr. Gommell, seconded by Mr. Poolman, it was resolved to appoint a pro
visional committee, consisting of Messrs. Ellery, Archer, Sydney Gibbons, and
Drs. Ralph, Robertson, and Wigg, to prepare a

code of regulations for the governance of the society, and to report to a
meeting to be held on Friday, 29th August. The Commissioner of Public Works
yes terday declared the undermentioned tenders to be respectively the lowest :
— Engine and boiler-house, &c.;, Alfred graving dock, Wil- liamstown, J. and
A. Overend, £4330 lis, Sil. ; furniture and fittings for the hospital for the
insane, Kew, James Kennedy, £512 Os. It was announced that tenders for the
supply of 6000 cubic yards of Milestone ashlar, on account of tlie Sewerage
and Water department, would bo re-advertised for, and the quality of the work
altered. Tlio Ballarat Star has been informed upon good authority that a
number of residents in the new electoral district of Elaine wish Air. Robert
Colvin to come forwnrd at the next election as a candidate to represent them
in the Legislative Assembly. A re quisition to that gentleman is in courso of
preparation. The nominations for the annual vaoaneies in the Richmond town
council were made yesterday, there being two candidates nomi nated for each
ward, viz. : For the North waTd, Air. AI. Egon (the retiringjconnciilor), and
Mr. James Du Feu ; for the Central ward, Air. T. E. Weaver and Air. John

Adam ; and for tho South ward, Air. Wm. Adam and Air. J. H. Derrick. Tlio only
persons nominated as auditors were Alessrs. J. O. Jones and Joseph Comfort,
who are therefore elected. The law courts may he said to be onoo more in full
work. The Nisi Prius sittings prior to Alichaelmas Term commence to-day. His
Honor tlio Acting Chief Justice, tnkes the cases to he tried before juries of
twelve, while All. J ustice Fellows will hear those to be tried before juries
of four. Air, Justice Moles worth will sit in Equity in the New Court-house.
His Honor Judge Pohhnan will preside at the General Sessions at tho County
Court, while his Honor Judge Cope will dispose of the remainder of tho County
Court civil business for July, at the Insol vency Court, Collins-street, In
the case of Hawkins v. Lafonta, heard yesterday at the County Court before his
Honor Judge Cope and a jury of four, the plaintiff sought to recover £1000 for
slander. Mr. G. P. Smith appeared for the plaintiff, Mr. M' Farland for the
defendant. The action had beon .removed from the .Supreme Court, ns the
plaintiff alleged that ho did not' possess the means of paying tho defend
cut's costs in the event of his failing to re cover damages. The defendant is
a sugar

sorter engaged by merchants to superintend sugars stored nt the free store of
the plaintiff Wm. C. Hawkins, situated in Flinders', lane. It appeared that a
quantity of sugar had been stored in the building referred to by Alessrs. Le
Roy, and it was found that after a time a, few bags were short. The plaintiff
had expressed a suspicion at the tine that the sugar had been taken away bv
some of Lafonta's men. Alessrs. Le Roy hail gfven instructions to have a man
tity of sugar stored on the third flat of Hawkins's warehouse. This and other
goods were removed to the cellar for the purpose of making room for a large
quantity of paper about being stored in January last. It was alleged by the
de- fendant that this sugar had been planted in the cellar by the plaintiff,
and that in fact it was his intention to steal the property The jury returned
a verdict for the plaintiff damages £150. Aladamo Johanna Lebens, who will
maho hpr first appearance in Australia at the Civil Service Cricket Club
concert on Saturday, at the Town Hall, comes hero with very high credentials.
Sho was a pupil of Professor Stockhausen, whose interpretation of the high-
class works of Schubert and Scliuman created quite a furore in London. Aladame
Lcbeue, in addition to other honore, holds a medal which she received at the
Beethoven centenary ' celebration in Vienna in 1S70 In addition to this, she
received a very hand"", some acknowledgment from the committee for her services
at the festival held in com- memorntion of Beethoven. As a vocalist, the
artiste has been educated not only in the music of tho authorities referred
to, but aUu in that of Gluck and other eminent com- posers. Tlie concert will

Soeiety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was Held yesterday afternoon
in tho rooms of tlie American consul, Alarkot buildings. The sub-committee
appointed at tlio pvevious meeting brought up a draft report of tlie year's
proceedings, which was adopted, and ordered to be printed and distributed pre
vious to the nnnual meeting, which will shortly bo held. It was resolved that
five hundred copies of an essay, which had been forwarded to tho committee
through .Mr. Ailamsnn, should be published for gratuitous ' circulation. AYc
have been shown a mode for drawing liquor from casks which claims to be very
successful in keeping tho contents drawn perfectly free from sediment, nnd at
the same time preventing air from finding its way into tiio barrel. The
invention ij known as Captain Beadon's patent, hut Mr. A. AV. Rogers is tho
solo agent for the cole- nic3._ To vine growers tlie plan will be oi service
if it accomplishes all it is said to, for all re-tapping aud tilting of casks
will be rendered unnecessary. At tho District Court recently, Patrick
Rad'crty, of the Pnlmcrston Hotel, Carlton, and Rodolph Koble, of tho Rouvcrie
Hotel, situated in tho same locality, wore each lined 20s., with 5s. costs,
for having allowed liquor to be sold in their respective licensed houses on a
Sunday. Yesterday Bridget Maria Lalor, of the Angel Hotel, Bom-he. street, was
fined 10s., with 5s. costs, for allowing disorderly persons to assemble on her
promises ; and for a similar offence, but one of a more aggravated nature,
John Lloyd, of the Maryborough Hotel, Bourke- street, was lined 40s., with 5s.
costs. Patk. Prendergast was charged at the City Court yesterday with arson.
Air. .Moles- worth asked for a remand to enable him to apply to the Supreme
Court for a writ of prohibition on the ground that the present charge was
actually the same as that ot which Prendergast hail been already ac quitted.
The bench said that they would not grant a remand for tlie purpose asked, !
but they consented to adjourn the ease for a | week in order that Air.
Aloleswortli might i produce authorities in support of His argu ment The
accused was admitted to hail. Letters patent were granted by the Attor. ney-
General yesterday to Air. S. S. Ritchie, of the Melbourne Meat Preserving
Company, for certnin "" Improvements in the Manu facture of Preserved Aleat.""
Air. Waters supported tho application, which was op posed by Alessrs. Alartyr,
Taylor anil Buck- land on behalf of Air. S. G. Reeves, of (!ee- .long. There
wcro several other cases set down for hearing yesterday, but tbey wero
adjourned for a week. A3 tlio train was starting for Brighton at seven o'clock
on Wednesday evening, n man named Roderick Rudelius attempted to jump into the
guard's van when the train was in motion. In pushing him back the guard caused
him to fail heavily oil the platform. He complained of pain in his ancle, and
being unable to walk was removed in a call to bis .residence in Hawthorn. The
police have since been informed that his left leg has been fractured in three
places. Tho woman Shannon seems now to bo in a fair way of recovery, and it is
likely that she will be removed to the gaol hospital in a day or two. She has
now the use of her speech. A very Borious accident occurred yester day, at
AYliittlesea, to a young girl named Alal ia Pugh. Sho rose iu the morning to
light tho fire at about five o'clock, and was afterwards found lying in the
fire place with iier head and face badly burned. It is supposed that after she
kindled the fire she went to sleep and fell into the grate. She was taken to
tho Alelbourne Hospital last night, where sho was pronounced to bo in a vary
dangerous condition. A lad named Jolm Payne, agedtwclvo yeai-3, was engaged
yesterday cutting wood > in lipping, in company with another boy, when he
received a severe out on the nock with an axe whieli tho other lad was using,
lie was taken to the Alelbourne Hospital. A young woman named Grace Jeffrey
was also admitted to the Alelbourne Hospital yesterday, suffering from tlie
fracture of her right leg, caused by her falling on tlie pave ment through
stepping oil a piece of orange peel. Tlio police made another raid upon the
Chinese gamblers last evening. Detectives Uartnev. Christie. Bailev. Duwden,
Doyle,

Goldheim, and Fook Sing went to a house in 3 Little Bourke-street east and
found sixteen I Chinese playing fan-tail. The house is kept I by a Chinaman
named Low AYy, and is next I door, to the house in whieli a number of i
similar offenders wero arrested about three I mouths ago. When tho detectives
entered | the Chinese quickly put all the money which | was about tlie table
into their pockets, and I some of them attempted to escape, but after | some
little resistance they were secured, B with tho exception of one who ran
upstairs 8 and got out through the back window. The I captives were taken to
tho police station, I and will be dealt witli by the city beuch | this
morning. 1 About eighteen months since a man named I Frederick Champion was
sentenced to three I months' imprisonment for stealing a pair of I ornamental
shells belonging to Mrs. Smith, I of Alurphy-street, Prahran. The shells |
wero returned to the owner. On tlio 19th i ult. they were again missed, and
after 5 somo inquiry it was found that Champion liad been offering again to
sell them to several persons. He was arrested, but tho shells have not yet
been found, and the prisoner has been remanded until Alonday that they may be
traced.

At tho ordinary meeting of tlie committee of the Benevolent Asylum yesterday,
it was reported by the superintendent that a doua- - tion of £10 had been
received from thy Ancient Order of Druids. A return showing the number of
applicants refused and their ages during tho past aix months, asked fer by the
hon. the Treasurer when tlie deputa tion waited on him on the 17th July, was
laid on tho table. It was decided to forward the return to Air. Langton. On
the motion of Air. Crouch, a letter of condolence xvas sent to the widow and
family of the late Mr. Tankard, who had been for a 'long time ah efficient
member of the committee. . A meeting of tho shareholders of the South
Alelbourne Gas Company was held last evening, at the Mechanics' Institute,
Emerald-hill. There was a large attendance of members, and Air. Joyce occupied
the chair. Tlie report showed -that the progress of the company hud been
greatly retarded by the high price of iron, and stated that there were 501
forfeited shares, on whieli tlie sum of 5s. per share had not been paid. An
expression of thanks was conveyed to the engineer of the com pany for his
assiduous labors on its hclialr, which was warmly endorsed by the meeting- At
the termination of the meeting; there wrs a ballot taken for the election of
two dirc.i

tors in the room of Messrs.' Mnnre and Joyce, -who retired by the effluxion of
time. Mr. \V. B. Furlong's benefit concert, tendered to him by the Melbourne
Musical Union, St. Francis' Church choir, and his pupils, took placo in the
Athonieum last Sight with fair BucccsgTlio vocal strength above-mentioned Was
'supplemented by the assistance of Madame Pott , as accompanist. Mr. Du
Boulay, tho concertina player, and Signer Giorza, who. gave two of his well
known and highly appreciated solos. As most of tins vocal soloists appoared as
lady or gentlemen amateurs, their various offorts cannot be criticised, though
Air. Fuilong himself can be mentioned as singing two songs of a robust
character with duo force and animation. The most attractive portion was the
performance of the chorus, who sang movements from Nabuco, L'Etoile du Nord,
and Mose in Kgitto, with a finish that did equal credit to themselves and
their conductors. After ' the conclusion of the concert, an impromptu ball was
started in which many of those present took spirited part. ... In consequence
of Mr. Beaumont s indispo sition a break has been necessitated"" in the
successful run of tho Lily of Killarney, and last night the Grand Duchess of
Gerolstein ' was presented, with Mr. Vernon in the lead- ing character of
Fritz. As might have been expected from tho ..excellence of other ap pearances
he has made, his impersonation of this was very clever, and though unable , to
do the vocal part so much credit as his pre decessor, he acted with more
appropriate spirit and action, nnd generally made the part much more amusing.
Tho rest of the cast was unchanged, and tho alteration in the leading
character in no way deteriorated the general result. . We are requested to
draw attention to a sale of choico plants to-day by Messrs. Bcaiicbamp and
Co., CoTlius-street. Mr. William Kidney, who is a candidate to re present the
Darling ward, town of Collingwood, in tho local council, will address a public
meet ing of the ratepayers this evening, at the Studlcy Arms Hotel,
Wellington-street. puiqiraitions Received.— Tho second volume of tb""'
Zoological and Acclimatisation Society's pro- ""»»dings- including tlio annual
report read in February last, lias been issued by . Messrs. St'lwcll nnd
Knight. The ichthyology of Aus tralia contributed by .Count do Cnstlenau,
forms n pmininnnt feature in the book, and worthily so too for the papers have
been prepared with great care and evince a wide and accurate knowledge 0f t.pe
subject under treatment. Tiro valuable reports by Mr. Samuel Wilson, of
Longeronong, upnn the Angora goat, and ostriches respectively, ar» only
another argument in fnvor of tho distri- b""i'on amongst good linnds of useful
animals and that may bo introduced into the country. A pr-per by Hons. A.
Roland on tlie produc tion of silkworm grain winds up the volume. Fir Leaves,
by C. S. Calverloy, author of Verses and Translations, is a very noatly
printed and got- np volume, just issued, as an Australian edition, by Mr.
George Robertson: This now work does not maintain tho. author's previously-
gained reputation, although some of tho trifle3in it— and it is pretty well
all syllabub— are above average merit- Sad Memories, for instance, is an cx-
iremclv happy blending of the comic with the heroic, and Mr. Cnlverlcy's
description of a war rior Tom cat, the Astur of Ids tribe, is quite equal 10
anything in Bon .Gaultior. Mr. Cal verloy s chiet fault is that Jie is too
.much of an imitator : but in justice it must be said of liiin that ho is
strictly impartial in bis attentions to anterior poets nnd poetasters.
